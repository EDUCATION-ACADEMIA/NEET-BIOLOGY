<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Phloem is a living tissue found in vascular plants that is responsible for transporting the soluble organic compounds produced during photosynthesis and known as photosynthates, including the sugar sucrose, to the various parts of the plant where they are required.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Sucrose, RFOs and polyols are transported in the sieve tubes to the sink organs in the transport phloem. All along the path, they can be leaked from and reloaded into the phloem via the same mechanism (not shown). Sucrose is unloaded into the release phloem where the hydrostatic pressure is supposed to be lower.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-phloem is the living tissue that transports the soluble organic compounds made during photosynthesis and known as photosynthates, in particular the sugar sucrose, to parts of the plant where needed. This transport process is called translocation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-These phloem vessels run from the leaves into every other part of the plant and are responsible for transporting dissolved organic solutes, such as sucrose and amino acids, from the sources to the sinks. Therefore, the vessel responsible for transporting sugars and amino acids is the phloem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The cotransport of a proton with sucrose allows movement of sucrose against its concentration gradient into the companion cells. occurs. From the companion cells, the sugar diffuses into the phloem sieve-tube elements through the plasmodesmata that link the companion cell to the sieve tube elements.
