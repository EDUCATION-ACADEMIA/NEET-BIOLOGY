<strong> Which two of the following are the similarities between blood circulatory system in animals and transport systems in plants? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** Both systems have tubes 
</p>
<p>(B) ** Both transport substances to all parts of the plant/body. 
</p>
<p>(C) Both are present in simple organisms 
</p>
<p>
<div style ="text-align:center">
<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The circulatory systems in animals and plants are alike because they both serve as transport systems that circulate substances throughout the body of the organism. Both types of circulatory systems move important molecules to the various parts and structures of the body.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The food has to be transported to all parts of the plant. This is done by the vascular tissue called the phloem. Thus, xylem and phloem transport substances in plants. In most animals the blood that circulates in the body distributes food and oxygen to different cells of the body.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The circulatory system is the “transportation system” for the body, and blood serves as the transport vehicle. Just as trucks deliver food, clothes, and other goods to houses and stores, blood circulates around the body, carrying and delivering the oxygen and nutrients needed by each cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Nutrients are transported along with water to the entire plant via the vascular tissue called xylem. The vascular tissue for the transport of food to the various parts of the plant is phloem. A lot of water is lost by plants in the form of vapour through stomata during transpiration.
