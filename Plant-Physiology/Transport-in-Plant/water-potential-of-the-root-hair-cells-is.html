<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-During absorption, water moves from soil to the root which means the water potential of cell sap of root is lower than that of soil. Thus, the cell sap will have a water potential lower than the pure water and soil solution during absorption.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The process by which water enters the root hair cell is called as osmosis. Due to the semi-permeability and low potential of water in the root than in the surrounding soil, water enters into root hair through osmosis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Water potential is higher within the soil than the root hair cell. Water is taken up by the roots of a plant and through the endodermis, before being moved into xylem tissue, which is in the centre of the root. The water potential inside the soil is higher than that of that root hair cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The matrix potential is always negative because the water attracted by the soil matrix has an energy state lower than that of pure water. Matrix potential only occurs in unsaturated soil above the water table.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Water always moves from an area of high water potential to an area of low water potential, i.e., from less negative to more negative. During water absorption by root hair, the water movement is possible if water potential of vacuolar sap is lower than root hair. Q.
