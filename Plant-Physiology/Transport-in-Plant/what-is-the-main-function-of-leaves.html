<strong> What is the main function of leaves? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Leaves provide support for growth and a place to store food. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** Leaves provide a place for photosynthesis to occur. 
</p>
<p>(C) Leaves absorb water and minerals and transport nutrients to the stem. 
</p>
<p>(D) Leaves create a barrier that prevents water in the plantâ€™s tissues from evaporating. 
</p>

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The main function of a leaf is to produce food for the plant by photosynthesis. Chlorophyll, the substance that gives plants their characteristic green colour, absorbs light energy. The internal structure of the leaf is protected by the leaf epidermis, which is continuous with the stem epidermis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-When it comes to photosynthesis, the most important parts of the plant are the leaves. Their cells and structures are specialized to take in light and allow for gas exchange with the air around them. They also contain vascular structures that transport water from the roots into the cells that carry out photosynthesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Leaf contains minute pores called stomata where gaseous exchange and transpiration occurs. The main functions of leaves are photosynthesis, exchange of gasses and transpiration.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Leaf prepares food for plants by the process of photosynthesis. Leaf has abundant stomata for gaseous exchange and performs the function of respiration. The leaf is the main site of water loss through the process of transpiration.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Leaves are adapted for photosynthesis and gaseous exchange. They are adapted for photosynthesis by having a large surface area, and contain openings, called stomata to allow carbon dioxide into the leaf and oxygen out.
