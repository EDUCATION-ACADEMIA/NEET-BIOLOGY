<meta name="description" content="Evapotranspiration also includes transpiration, which is the water movement from the soil to the atmosphere via plants. Transpiration occurs when plants take up liquid water from the soil and release water vapor into the air from their leaves.The water eventually is released to the atmosphere as vapor via the plants stomata-tiny, closeable, pore-like structures on the surfaces of leaves. Overall, this uptake of water at the roots, transport of water through plant tissues, and release of vapor by leaves is known as transpiration.When the stomata are open, plants lose water vapour through them as well. The water vapour evaporates from the cells lining the air spaces and then passes out of the leaf through the stomata by diffusion. This loss of water vapour is known as transpiration.Transpiration is the loss of water from the plant through evaporation at the leaf surface. It is the main driver of water movement in the xylem. Transpiration is caused by the evaporation of water at the leaf–atmosphere interface; it creates negative pressure (tension) equivalent to –2 MPa at the leaf surface.Transpiration is the process of water movement through a plant and its evaporation from aerial parts, such as leaves, stems and flowers. Water is necessary for plants but only a small amount of water taken up by the roots is used for growth and metabolism. The remaining 97–99.5% is lost by transpiration and guttation.">

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Evapotranspiration also includes transpiration, which is the water movement from the soil to the atmosphere via plants. Transpiration occurs when plants take up liquid water from the soil and release water vapor into the air from their leaves.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The water eventually is released to the atmosphere as vapor via the plant’s stomata-tiny, closeable, pore-like structures on the surfaces of leaves. Overall, this uptake of water at the roots, transport of water through plant tissues, and release of vapor by leaves is known as transpiration.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-When the stomata are open, plants lose water vapour through them as well. The water vapour evaporates from the cells lining the air spaces and then passes out of the leaf through the stomata by diffusion. This loss of water vapour is known as transpiration.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Transpiration is the loss of water from the plant through evaporation at the leaf surface. It is the main driver of water movement in the xylem. Transpiration is caused by the evaporation of water at the leaf–atmosphere interface; it creates negative pressure (tension) equivalent to –2 MPa at the leaf surface.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Transpiration is the process of water movement through a plant and its evaporation from aerial parts, such as leaves, stems and flowers. Water is necessary for plants but only a small amount of water taken up by the roots is used for growth and metabolism. The remaining 97–99.5% is lost by transpiration and guttation.
