<title>What gas do plants give off after conducting photosynthesis that humans/animals need in order to live?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen as a byproduct. The oxygen given out is utilized by humans and other animals for carrying out their own cellular functions.The leftovers from making the plant food is another gas called oxygen. This oxygen is released from the leaves into the air. Take a look at the picture below to see this system in action. This leftover oxygen is really important because humans and other animals need this oxygen to live which we breathe in from the air.Animals, during respiration, take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide gas. Plants, on the other hand, utilize this carbon dioxide gas in the process of photosynthesis to produce food and release oxygen in the atmosphere. Thus, we can say that plants and animals help each other in exchange of gases in the atmosphere.Photosynthesis provides most of the oxygen that humans and animals breathe. Heres how it works: Tree and plant roots absorb water, as well as minerals and nutrients, from the soil. At the same time, the leaves or needles absorb carbon dioxide from the air.The oxygen that is produced is released from the same tiny holes through which the carbon dioxide entered. Even the oxygen that is released serves another purpose. Other organisms, such as animals, use oxygen to aid in their survival. The whole process of photosynthesis is a transfer of energy from the Sun to a plant.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen as a byproduct. The oxygen given out is utilized by humans and other animals for carrying out their own cellular functions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The leftovers from making the plant food is another gas called oxygen. This oxygen is released from the leaves into the air. Take a look at the picture below to see this system in action. This leftover oxygen is really important because humans and other animals need this oxygen to live which we breathe in from the air.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Animals, during respiration, take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide gas. Plants, on the other hand, utilize this carbon dioxide gas in the process of photosynthesis to produce food and release oxygen in the atmosphere. Thus, we can say that plants and animals help each other in exchange of gases in the atmosphere.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Photosynthesis provides most of the oxygen that humans and animals breathe. Hereâ€™s how it works: Tree and plant roots absorb water, as well as minerals and nutrients, from the soil. At the same time, the leaves or needles absorb carbon dioxide from the air.

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The oxygen that is produced is released from the same tiny holes through which the carbon dioxide entered. Even the oxygen that is released serves another purpose.
