<strong> Why do you think the processes of photosynthesis and respiration are interrelated? 
</strong>
<p>(A) because in plants, both photosynthesis and respiration are continuous processes that take place through day and night 
</p>
<p>(B) ** because the oxygen produced in photosynthesis is used in respiration, and the carbon dioxide produced in respiration is used in photosynthesis 
</p>
<p>(C) because the energy released during respiration is used in photosynthesis, and the energy released during photosynthesis is used in respiration

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Photosynthesis makes glucose which is used in cellular respiration for making ATP. The glucose is then transformed back into carbon dioxide, which is used in photosynthesis. It helps cells to release and store energy. It maintains the atmospheric balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-While photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide and releases oxygen, cellular respiration requires oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. It is the released oxygen that is used by us and most other organisms for cellular respiration. We breathe in that oxygen, which is carried through our blood to all our cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Plants release oxygen which is a by-product of photosynthesis, and we breathe in oxygen so that our cells can carry out cellular respiration and generate ATP. Respiration and photosynthesis are biological reactions in the environment that complement each other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The carbon dioxide is taken up from the surroundings in used in photosynthesis. The glucose and oxygen synthesized during photosynthesis act as a substrate for cellular respiration in plants. Respiration results in the production of adenosine triphosphate which acts as the energy currency of the plant cells.
