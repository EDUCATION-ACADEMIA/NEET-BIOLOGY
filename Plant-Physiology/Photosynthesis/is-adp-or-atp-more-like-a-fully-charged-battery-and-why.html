<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Is ADP or ATP more like a fully charged battery, and why? ADP, because it has three phosphate groups; breaking and reforming the bonds among them releases energy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-ADP has only two phosphate groups (and fewer bonds), so itâ€™s like a par-tially charged battery. ATP has three phos-phate groups, so it is like a fully charged battery and has more bonds available for energy storage.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The correct answer: ADP has less potential energy than ATP b. Because ADP has only two phosphate groups. An ATP molecule is formed with three phosphate groups associated with adenine residue. The two terminal phosphate bonds of the three phosphate groups are high energy bonds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-ATP resembles a fully charged battery because it can yield energy when the third phosphate is removed, also forming ADP. ADP is like a partially charged battery that can be recharged when energy is added to link a third phosphate group, reforming ATP.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-ADP is continually converted to ATP by the addition of a phosphate during the process of cellular respiration. ATP carries much more energy than ADP. As the cell requires more energy, it uses energy from the breakdown of food molecules to attach a free phosphate group to an ADP molecule in order to make ATP.
