<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-"A mature leafy tree produces as much oxygen in a season as 10 people inhale in a year.” “A 100-foot tree, 18 inches diameter at its base, produces 6, 000 pounds of oxygen.” “On average, one tree produces nearly 260 pounds of oxygen each year. Two mature trees can provide enough oxygen for a family of four."
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-It is proposed that one large tree can provide a day’s supply of oxygen for up to four people. Trees also store carbon dioxide in their fibers helping to clean the air and reduce the negative effects that this CO2 could have had on our environment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Two mature trees can provide enough oxygen for a family of four.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-About the Infographic: How many trees does it take to offset the food you eat? About 15 trees offset the carbon dioxide from consuming a 2, 000-calorie diet. How many trees does it take to offset your fossil fuel consumption? About 730 trees offset the average carbon dioxide released for each person’s fossil fuel usage.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A human breathes about 9.5 tonnes of air in a year, but oxygen only makes up about 23 per cent of that air, by mass, and we only extract a little over a third of the oxygen from each breath. That works out to a total of about 740kg of oxygen per year. Which is, very roughly, seven or eight trees’ worth.
