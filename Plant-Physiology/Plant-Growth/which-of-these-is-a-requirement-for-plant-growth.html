<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Water is also an important necessity during the process of photosynthesis. Also, extension growth occurs due to water as it makes cells healthy to divide. Various enzymatic activities occur in water as a medium. Thus, water is required for all basic requirements of plants to grow, sustain, and develop.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The capillary water is the water present in the minute pores of the soil and is held against gravity for the roots of the plant to absorb. This capillary water that is present in the soil is available to the plants for uptake. Capillary water is used during root absorption in plants.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Water is an essential nutrient for plants and comprises up to 95% of a plant’s tissue. It is required for a seed to sprout, and as the plant grows, water carries nutrients throughout the plant. Water is responsible for several important functions within plant tissues.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Plants need five things in order to grow: sunlight, proper temperature, moisture, air, and nutrients. These five things are provided by the natural or artificial environments where the plants live.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Requirements for growth Plants need air, light, warmth, water and nutrients to be healthy. If a plant doesn’t have one of these requirements it could affect its growth or even die. For example, a plant that is kept in a dark place will grow tall and spindly in search of light and then become weak and die.
