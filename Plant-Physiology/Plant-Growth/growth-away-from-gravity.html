<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Negative geotropism refers to the upward growth of plants, growing against the force of gravity. Negative geotropism occurs in the shoots of plants, which includes mainly the stem tissues and also part of the leaf tissues.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-If the plant part moves against the direction of gravity, it is negative geotropism. The stem of a plant moves upwards against the direction of gravity, so the stem of a plant shows negative geotropism.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Gravitropisms. Phototropism is a response to the stimulus of light, whereas gravitropism (also called geotropism) is a response to the stimulus of gravity . When the stem grows against the force of gravity (upwards), this is known as a negative gravitropism.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-If the movement of the plant parts is towards the pull of gravity, it is known as positive geotropism; whereas if the movement of the plant parts is in the direction opposite to the pull of gravity, it is known as negative geotropism.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Gravitropism/geotropism is growth response of plant in direction of gravity. Positive geotropism is the movement towards the center of the earth while negatively refers to away from it. Growth responses towards or away from moisture are known as positive or negative hydrotropism respectively.
