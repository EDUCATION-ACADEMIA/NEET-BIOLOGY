<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The increase in length of the shoot and the root is referred to as primary growth. It is the result of cell division in the shoot apical meristem. Secondary growth is characterized by an increase in thickness or girth of the plant. It is caused by cell division in the lateral meristem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In botany, secondary growth is the growth that results from cell division in the cambia or lateral meristems and that causes the stems and roots to thicken, while primary growth is growth that occurs as a result of cell division at the tips of stems and roots, causing them to elongate, and gives rise to primary tissue.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-All plant roots begin in primary growth, which is a lengthening of plant organs. Primary growth involves the root apical meristem, primary meristems, and primary tissues. Figure 11.1.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Primary growth results in the increase in length of the primary plant body. Primary growth occurs at the apical meristem (a meristem located at the tip of a stem). A meristem is a region of undifferentiated cells from which new cells arise through cellular division.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-All plants experience primary growth, which is the lengthening of both roots and stems. This growth occurs because of cell division in apical meristems, which may continue indefinitely in plants.
