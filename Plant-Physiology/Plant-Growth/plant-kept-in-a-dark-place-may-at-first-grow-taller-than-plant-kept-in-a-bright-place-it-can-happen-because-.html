<strong> Plant kept in a dark place may at first grow taller than plant kept in a bright place. It can happen because ____ 
</strong>
<p>(A) The plant can make their own food (photosynthesis) without light 
</p>
<p>(B) The plant get energy from soil to photosynthesis. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** The plant use the food stored in it so that the stem can grow longer. 
</p>
<p>(D) It get taller because it can absorb energy from air. 
</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-(Explanation: seeds store a lot of chemical energy in the form of fats and proteins that can be used to grow in the dark. Once this stored chemical energy is exhausted, the plant requires light to grow taller.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-That happens because plants need light for photosynthesis – without it, they start to wilt and eventually die because they will not have any food or nutrients. If left for so long, the leaves will eventually dry and fall off the plant.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In order to prevent the previously formed starch from interfering, we remove the starch and it is done by keeping the plant in dark. When the plant is in dark, the photosynthesis does not occur and the stored starch is used up. Was this answer helpful?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The main reason for plants growing taller in the dark is that they are using up the extra energy that they’ve stored up throughout the day and will not require light until this has depleted. However, this does not mean that you can leave your plant in the dark for long periods of time to try increase its size.
