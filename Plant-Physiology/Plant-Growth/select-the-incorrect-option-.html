<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-So, the correct option is ‘Secondary growth’.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Lateral meristem is responsible for the increase in the girth of the stem. It is found beneath the bark (called cork cambium) and in vascular bundles of dicot roots and stems (called vascular cambium) as thin layers. It is composed of such initials which divide mainly in one plane and increases the girth of the stem.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Primary growth results in the increase in length of the primary plant body. Primary growth occurs at the apical meristem (a meristem located at the tip of a stem). A meristem is a region of undifferentiated cells from which new cells arise through cellular division.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The increase in length of the shoot and the root is referred to as primary growth, and is the result of cell division in the shoot apical meristem. Secondary growth is characterized by an increase in thickness or girth of the plant, and is caused by cell division in the lateral meristem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Secondary growth is characterized by an increase in thickness or girth of the plant. It is caused by cell division in the lateral meristem. Herbaceous plants mostly undergo primary growth, with little secondary growth or increase in thickness.
