<strong> Why do seeds being stored for future use have to be kept dry 
</strong>
<p>(A) Water will cause the radicle to rot 
</p>
<p>(B) Water interferes with the actions of enzymes 
</p>
<p>(C) Water will prevent the embryo from growing 
</p>
<p>(D) ** Water can cause the seeds to germinate

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-If freshly harvested grains are stored without drying they may spoil or get attacked by microorganisms, losing their germination capacity. Hence, before storing them the grains are properly dried in the sun to reduce moisture in them. This prevents the attack by insects, pests, bacteria, and fungi.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-When completely immersed in water, the proper oxygen exchange (aeration) does not take place which prevents the full germination. The oxygen which is dissolved in water does not enters the seed due to excess water thus preventing germination.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Keep them in dry and cool place to extend their viability. Seeds easily re-absorb moisture. To maintain dryness, keep seeds in air-tight containers like tin cans or glass jars with tight fitting lids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Most seeds need to take up water to germinate; this is known as imbibition GLOSSARY imbibitionthe taking up of liquid, causing swelling. . Water: hydrates enzymes in the seed, activating them. As a result the seed begins to release energy from its food store for growth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Thus, based on the above information when the seeds are kept in water, they get swelled and increased in size, called the soaking of seeds. Hence, the correct answer is option (A).
