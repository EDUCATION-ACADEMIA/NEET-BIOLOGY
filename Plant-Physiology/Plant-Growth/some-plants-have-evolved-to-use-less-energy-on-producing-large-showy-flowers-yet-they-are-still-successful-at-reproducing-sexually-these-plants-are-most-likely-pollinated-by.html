<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The more exclusive the relationship between a plant species and its pollinator, the better for the plant; If a pollinator visits only one species of flower, that flower is assured that its pollen will find its way to another of its kind.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Plants and their pollinators form a mutualistic relationship, a relationship in which each benefits from the other. In the plant-pollinator relationship, the pollinator benefits by feeding on food rewards provided by the flower, primarily nectar and pollen.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Unlike the typical insect-pollinated flowers, flowers adapted to pollination by wind do not produce nectar or scent. In wind-pollinated species, the microsporangia hang out of the flower, and, as the wind blows, the lightweight pollen is carried with it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Angiosperms evolved during the late Cretaceous Period, about 125-100 million years ago. Angiosperms have developed flowers and fruit as ways to attract pollinators and protect their seeds, respectively. Flowers have a wide array of colors, shapes, and smells, all of which are for the purpose of attracting pollinators.
