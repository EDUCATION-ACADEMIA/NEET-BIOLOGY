<strong> Vascular plants typically grow larger than nonvascular plants because 
</strong>
<p>(A) they are able to absorb water and nutrients directly into all of their tissues from the environment. 
</p>
<p>(B) they are able to photosynthesize. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** they are able to deliver water and nutrients more efficiently to all of their tissues. 
</p>
<p>(D) they produce spores that can liver in very harsh conditions. 
</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Vascular plants are also known as ‘higher’ plants because they have systems of tubes that move food and water that make them grow to be higher than nonvascular plants.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The combination of one xylem and one phloem strand adjacent to each other is known as a vascular bundle. The evolution of vascular tissue in plants allowed them to evolve to larger sizes than non-vascular plants, which lack these specialized conducting tissues and are thereby restricted to relatively small sizes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-They do not have a phloem or xylem. Nonvascular plants are very small because their lack of a vascular system means they do not have the mechanics required for transporting food and water far distances. Another characteristic of nonvascular plants that sets them apart from vascular plants is that they lack roots.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Vascular systems are able to allow plants to grow bigger due to the ability to transport nutrients and sugar over why distances. This also allows plants to live further away from water sources, and dominate early terrestrial environments. The vascular system of plants includes the xylem and the phloem.
