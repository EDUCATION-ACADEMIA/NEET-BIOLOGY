<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-As it turns out, some of the light energy absorbed by pigments in leaves is converted to a different form: chemical energy. Light energy is converted to chemical energy during the first stage of photosynthesis, which involves a series of chemical reactions known as the light-dependent reactions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Light-independent reaction is a series of biochemical reactions in photosynthesis not requiring light to proceed, and ultimately produce organic molecules from carbon dioxide. The energy released from ATP (produced during the light reactions) drives this metabolic pathway.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The light reaction is also known as photolysis reaction and takes place in the presence of light. It usually takes place in the grana of chloroplasts. The photosystems have pigment molecules.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Photosynthesis: Process usually occurring within chloroplasts whereby chlorophyll traps solar energy and carbon dioxide is reduced to a carbohydrate.
