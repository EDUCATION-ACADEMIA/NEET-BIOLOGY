</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Dedifferentiation is a cellular process by which cells grow in reverse, from a partially or terminally differentiated stage to a less differentiated stage within their own lineage. In general, the phenomenon is manifested by a change in the shape, gene expression pattern, protein expression pattern and function.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Solution : The living differentiated cells, that have lost the capacity to divide can regain the power of division under certain conditions, this phenomenon is termed as de-differentiation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Differentiation: Formation of tracheary elements. Dedifferentiation: Formation of vascular cambium and cork cambium (meristems) from fully differentiated meristems. Redifferentiation: Formation of secondary xylem and phloem from dedifferentiated cells of the cambial ring.
