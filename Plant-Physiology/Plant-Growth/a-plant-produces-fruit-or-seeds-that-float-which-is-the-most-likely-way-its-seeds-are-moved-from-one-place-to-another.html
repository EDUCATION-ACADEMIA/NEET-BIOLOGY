<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The most common methods are wind, water, animals, explosion and fire. Dandelion seeds float away in the wind. To make sure at least some of the seeds land in a suitable growing place, the plant has to produce lots of seeds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In the plant kingdom, water is natural and one of the fundamental sources of seed dispersal. In this mode of seed dispersal, seeds float away from their parent plant in rivers or ponds due to their light weight. Plants which grow near water bodies usually rely on water to transport their seeds to different places.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Seed dispersion or seed dispersal is the movement or transport of seeds away from the parent plant. This is to avoid the competition between parent plant and their siblings for light, space, water and nutrients. Suggest Corrections. 1.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Seed Dispersal by Water Coconut, palm, mangroves, water lily, water mint, are a few examples of plants whose seed are dispersed by the water.
