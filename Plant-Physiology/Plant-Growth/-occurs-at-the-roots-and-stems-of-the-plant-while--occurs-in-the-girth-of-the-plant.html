<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-This is called primary growth, and it develops from the apical meristem. As time passes, besides elongation of the roots and stems, the circumference of the plants starts to increase, and it is called secondary growth. Secondary growth is a characteristic feature of dicotyledons.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In botany, secondary growth is the growth that results from cell division in the cambia or lateral meristems and that causes the stems and roots to thicken, while primary growth is growth that occurs as a result of cell division at the tips of stems and roots, causing them to elongate, and gives rise to primary tissue.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Secondary growth occurs at the lateral meristems. The cells at the meristems undergo cellular division, where each cell multiplies into two daughter cells and add to the cellular material collectively called tissue. Secondary growth in plants produces secondary phloem and xylem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The increase in length of the shoot and the root is referred to as primary growth. It is the result of cell division in the shoot apical meristem. Secondary growth is characterized by an increase in thickness or girth of the plant. It is caused by cell division in the lateral meristem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Cambium: The girth of the stem or root increases due to the presence of ‘Cambium’. Cambiums are defined as the lateral meristems that participate in the secondary growth of dicots.
