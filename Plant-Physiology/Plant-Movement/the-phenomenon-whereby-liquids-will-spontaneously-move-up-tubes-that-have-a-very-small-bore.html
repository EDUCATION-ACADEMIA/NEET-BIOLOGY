Surface tension is an important factor in the phenomenon of capillarity.Capillarity is a physical phenomenon in which liquids flow without the help of gravity. Liquid even rise to a height against gravity, through narrow tubes. Capillary action is due to the phenomenon of surface tension of liquid as well as adhesive forces between liquid molecules and molecules of the narrow tube.Capillary action is the phenomenon in which liquids rise up into a narrow tube called a capillary. It results when cohesive forces, the intermolecular forces in the liquid, are weaker than adhesive forces, the attraction between a liquid and the surface of the capillary.Hint: Capillarity is a phenomenon by which the liquid moves without the help of gravity.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Tubes having very small diameters (narrow cylindrical tubes) are called capillary. If these narrow tubes dipped in a liquid it is observed that liquid in the capillary either rises (or) falls relative to the surrounding liquid level. This phenomenon is called capillary action and such tubes are called capillary.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-5.2 Capillary Phenomena in Tubes Capillary rise or capillarity is a phenomenon in which liquid spontaneously rises or falls in a narrow space such as a thin tube or in the voids of a porous material. Surface tension is an important factor in the phenomenon of capillarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Capillarity is a physical phenomenon in which liquids flow without the help of gravity. Liquid even rise to a height against gravity, through narrow tubes. Capillary action is due to the phenomenon of surface tension of liquid as well as adhesive forces between liquid molecules and molecules of the narrow tube.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Capillary action is the phenomenon in which liquids rise up into a narrow tube called a capillary. It results when cohesive forces, the intermolecular forces in the liquid, are weaker than adhesive forces, the attraction between a liquid and the surface of the capillary.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Hint: Capillarity is a phenomenon by which the liquid moves without the help of gravity. The liquid level rises to some height against the gravitational force, through the narrow tube. This action is due to the phenomenon of surface tension of the liquid.
