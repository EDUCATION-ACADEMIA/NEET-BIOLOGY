<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Sunflowers display heliotropic movement even on cloudy days, suggesting that there is a learned diurnal rhythm that is followed in the absence of a strong directional light. Leaves and floral parts both exhibit heliotropism. Floral heliotropism is controlled by motor cells located just below the flower head.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Sunflower grow in accordance to sun is an example of positive phototropism.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A tropism is a directional growth or movement response of an organism, in this case a plant, either toward or away from a stimulus. In this example, the stimulus is sunlight and the response is for the sunflower to grow toward the light.
