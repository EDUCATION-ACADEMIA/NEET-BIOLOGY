<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The trachea is often called the windpipe. It’s a key part of your respiratory system. When you breathe in, air travels from your nose or mouth through your larynx. It then passes through your trachea to your bronchi.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The TRACHEA (windpipe) is the passage leading from your pharynx to the lungs. The RIBS are bones supporting and protecting your chest cavity. They move a small amount and help the lungs to expand and contract. The trachea divides into the two main BRONCHI (tubes), one for each lung.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The airway that leads from the larynx (voice box) to the bronchi (large airways that lead to the lungs). Also called windpipe.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Also called trachea. Anatomy of the respiratory system showing the trachea, the right and left lungs and their lobes, and the bronchi.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The primary function of the trachea is to transport air to and from the lungs. Without a trachea, a person would not be able to breathe.
