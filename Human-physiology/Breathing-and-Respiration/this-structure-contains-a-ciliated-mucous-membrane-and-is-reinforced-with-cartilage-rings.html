<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Larynx. The larynx is a cartilaginous structure inferior to the laryngopharynx that connects the pharynx to the trachea and helps regulate the volume of air that enters and leaves the lungs. The structure of the larynx is formed by several pieces of cartilage.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-This self-clearing mechanism is termed mucociliary clearance. The trachea is surrounded by 16 to 20 rings of hyaline cartilage; these ‘rings’ are incomplete and C-shaped.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The trachea (windpipe) is the part of the airway that continues below the larynx (LAIR-inks). The walls of the trachea (TRAY-kee-uh) have stiff rings of cartilage to keep it open. The trachea is also lined with cilia, which sweep fluids and foreign particles out of the airway to keep them out of the lungs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The respiratory system is lined with a mucous membrane that secretes mucus. The mucus traps smaller particles like pollen or smoke. Hairlike structures called cilia line the mucous membrane and move the particles trapped in the mucus out of the nose.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The trachea is lined with a moist mucous-membrane layer composed of cells containing small hairlike projections called cilia. The cilia project into the channel (lumen) of the trachea to trap particles. There are also cells and ducts in the mucous membrane that secrete mucus droplets and water molecules.
