<strong> During each cardiac cycle two prominent sounds are produced which can be easily heard through a stethoscope. If during check up the heart sounds are not clear it indicates

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The first sound (lub) is associated with the closure of the tricuspid and bicuspid valves during ventricular systole to prevent the backflow of blood to atria. The second sound (dub) is associated with the closure of semilunar valves during ventricular diastole to prevent the backflow of blood to ventricles.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-During each cardiac cycle, two prominent sounds are produced which can be easily heard through a stethoscope. The first heart sound (lub) is associated with the closure of the tricuspid and bicuspid valves whereas the second heart sound (dub) is associated with the closure of the semilunar valves.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The two distinct sounds are heard, a low, slightly prolonged “lub” (first sound) occurring at the beginning of ventricular contraction or systole and a sharper, higher-pitched “dup” (second sound), caused by the closure of aortic and pulmonary valves at the end of systole.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In a healthy individual, there are two normal heart sounds called lub and dub. Lub is the first heart sound. It is associated with the closure of the tricuspid and bicuspid valves at the beginning of systole. The second heart sound dub is associated with the closure of the semilunar valves at the beginning of diastole.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The valve ‘behind’ each chamber (atrium or ventricle) will close – making a heartbeat noise – and then the chamber contracts to push blood through the open valve infront. The AV valves are behind the ventricles and the SL valves are (kind of) behind the atria.
