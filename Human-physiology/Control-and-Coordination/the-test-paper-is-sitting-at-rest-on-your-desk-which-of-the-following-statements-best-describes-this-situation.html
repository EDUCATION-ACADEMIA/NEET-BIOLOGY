<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Q. Test paper is sitting at rest on your desk. Which of the following statements best describes this situation? There are no forces acting on your paper.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Newton’s First Law of Motion assumes that the forces acting on the object are balanced. When a book is at rest on a table, the force of gravity pushing down on the book is equal to the force of the desk pushing up. The forces acting on the book are balanced, so the book stays put.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If the object is at rest, net force on the object is equal to zero; therefore, the downward force (weight) must be equal to the upward force (normal force). Since weight acts in the downward direction it will be negative. The total sum of the forces must be zero, in order for the object to be at rest.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Newton’s First Law is the law of inertia. An object with no net forces acting on it which is initially at rest will remain at rest. If it is moving, it will continue to move in a straight line with constant velocity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-For both stationary and moving objects with unchanging speed and direction, all the forces acting on the objects are in balance with each other, i.e. they all cancel each other out.
