<title>Who is the scientist who conducted experiments on phototropism? Who is the scientist who experimented with light application in plants?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="In 1880, Charles Darwin, with the help of his son researched phototropism on canary grass and oat coleoptiles and recorded his observations in the book The Power of Movement in Plants. They observed the bending of seedlings towards sunlight.Although Charles Bonnet (1720–1793) attributed the process of photomorphogenesis to light, he failed to recognize the importance of light for phototropism. Instead, his phototropism experiments (Figure 1) led him to believe that plants were turning toward the warmth of the sun (Bonnet, 1754, 1779; Sachs et al., 1890).Seeds push little leaves up from the ground into the light. A house plant in a dark room will grow toward the light. This movement in response to light is called phototropism. When a plant moves toward the light, its called positive tropism.Phototropism, or the differential cell elongation exhibited by a plant organ in response to directional blue light, provides the plant with a means to optimize photosynthetic light capture in the aerial portion and water and nutrient acquisition in the roots.One important light response in plants is phototropism, which involves growth toward-or away from-a light source. Positive phototropism is growth towards a light source; negative phototropism is growth away from light.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In 1880, Charles Darwin, with the help of his son researched phototropism on canary grass and oat coleoptiles and recorded his observations in the book ‘The Power of Movement in Plants’. They observed the bending of seedlings towards sunlight.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Although Charles Bonnet (1720–1793) attributed the process of photomorphogenesis to light, he failed to recognize the importance of light for phototropism. Instead, his phototropism experiments (Figure 1) led him to believe that plants were turning toward the warmth of the sun (Bonnet, 1754, 1779; Sachs et al., 1890).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Seeds push little leaves up from the ground into the light. A house plant in a dark room will grow toward the light. This movement in response to light is called phototropism. When a plant moves toward the light, it’s called positive tropism.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Phototropism, or the differential cell elongation exhibited by a plant organ in response to directional blue light, provides the plant with a means to optimize photosynthetic light capture in the aerial portion and water and nutrient acquisition in the roots.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-One important light response in plants is phototropism, which involves growth toward-or away from-a light source. Positive phototropism is growth towards a light source; negative phototropism is growth away from light.
