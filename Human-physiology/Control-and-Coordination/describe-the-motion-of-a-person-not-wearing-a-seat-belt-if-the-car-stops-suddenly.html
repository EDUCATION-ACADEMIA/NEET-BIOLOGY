<strong> Describe the motion of a person NOT wearing a seat belt if the car stops suddenly 
</strong>
<p>(A) The person and car will stop together 
</p>
<p>(B) The person will stop faster than the car because they are lighter 
</p>
<p>(C) ** The car will stop and the person will keep moving forward because of inertia 
</p>
<p>(D) The car will stop and the person will speed up 
</p>
<p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-As per Newton’s first law of motion, when a car abruptly stops or crashes, Due to inertia of motion, a person sitting in a moving car may be pushed forward when the car stops abruptly, potentially causing damage. To prevent the above accident, seat belt must be used while driving car.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-If the car were to abruptly stop and the seat belts were not being worn, then the passengers in motion would continue in motion. Assuming a negligible amount of friction between the passengers and the seats, the passengers would likely be propelled from the car and be hurled into the air.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Law of inertia. It is given that name because inertia is the tendency of an object to resist any change in its motion until an unbalanced force acts on it. That is the same thing that Newton’s first law states. 6.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Seat belts When the car crashes, there is no unbalanced force acting on the person, so they continue forward (Newton’s First Law). The person moves against the seat belt, exerting a force on it. The seat belt then exerts a force back on the person (Newton’s Third Law).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-When the car hits the wall, you would keep moving in a straight line and at a constant speed until the dashboard applies a force. Seat belts hold you and passengers down, protecting them from their own inertia.

</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 11 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Which of Newton’s laws explains why the person continues forward even though the car stopped? 
</p>
<p>
