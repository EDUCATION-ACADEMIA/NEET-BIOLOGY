<strong> The moon has a smaller mass than the Earth. If you were able to travel to the moon your weight would ____ 
</strong>
<p>(A) Increase 
</p>
<p>(B) ** Decrease 
</p>
<p>(C) Stay the same 
</p>
<p>(D) Vary with day and night

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Since the Moon is smaller than Earth, it has a weaker gravitational pull. In fact, the Moon only has 1/6 the gravity that Earth does. This means you weigh six times less on the Moon than you do on Earth!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-If you were to travel to the Moon, your mass would stay the same, but because the Moon has less mass than the Earth, the force between you and the Moon would be less than the force between you and the Earth. This means you would weigh less on the Moon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If you were standing on the Moon, your mass–or the amount of stuff you’re made of–wouldn’t change. However, your weight would change because the gravity on the Moon is much weaker than it is on Earth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-On the moon, where gravity is very low, you would weigh less than on earth. On the planet Jupiter, where gravity is stronger, you would weigh much more than you do here. On the sun, gravity is so strong that you would weigh about 27 times as much as on earth!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A man weigh less on the moon because the moon has less mass than Earth, due to this moon exerts a lesser force of attraction on objects. Hence, an object weighs less on the moon than on the Earth.

</p>
<p>How much does your weight decrease on the moon? 
</p>
<p>

<p>What do you think will happen to your weight if you were able to land on a planet that has more mass than Earth? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 8 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Why do you weigh less on the moon than you do on Earth but have the same mass? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 9 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What would happen to Earth if the moon was smaller? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 10 :
</strong>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 11 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>How is your weight on the moon different from your weight on the Earth? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 12 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What is the difference between your weight on Earth and your weight on the moon? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 13 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Has a bigger mass than the Earth if you were able to travel to planet Jupiter What happens to your weight? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 14 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Why is it that the Earth and the moon do not bump when they travel around the sun? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 15 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Would your mass change if you were to travel to another planet Why or why not?
