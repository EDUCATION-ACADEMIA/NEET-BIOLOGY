<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Nastic movements are non-directional responses to stimuli (e.g. temperature, humidity, light irradiance), and are usually associated with plants. The movement can be due to changes in turgor. Decrease in turgor pressure causes shrinkage while increase in turgor pressure brings about swelling.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The movement or growth of any part of a plant in response to an external stimulus is called tropism or tropic movement.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The non-directive growth movements of plants, wherein the direction of stimulus is not the determinant of the direction of movement, are known as nastic movements. These movements always occur in one direction. Examples: Seismonasty, photonasty, thermonasty etc.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Final Answer: The directional movement of plants in response to contact is thigmotropism.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Chemotropism: The directional movement of plants toward a chemical stimulus is known as chemotropism.
