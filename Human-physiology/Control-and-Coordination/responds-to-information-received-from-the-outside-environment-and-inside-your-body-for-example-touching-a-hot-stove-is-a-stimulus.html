<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The nervous system takes in information through our senses, processes the information and triggers reactions, such as making your muscles move or causing you to feel pain. For example, if you touch a hot plate, you reflexively pull back your hand and your nerves simultaneously send pain signals to your brain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The nervous system helps all the parts of the body to communicate with each other. It also reacts to changes both outside and inside the body. The nervous system uses both electrical and chemical means to send and receive messages.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-External stimuli are received by the receptor cells, which, in most cases, are neurons. (In a few instances, a receptor is a non-nervous sensory epithelial cell, such as a hair cell of the inner ear or a taste cell, which stimulates adjacent neurons.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Stimulus: A detectable change happens in the environment. Receptors: The receptor convert environmental stimuli into electrical nerve signals. Neurons: The nerve signals are transferred to the central nervous system via neurons. Effectors: Effectors produce a response as a result of the stimulus.
