<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Auxin is sent to the part of the plant facing away from the light, where it promotes cell elongation, thus causing the plant to bend towards the light.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Auxin is the hormone that causes bending of the plant towards light. Auxin synthesized by the cells present in area receiving light moves towards the shady side of the stem and causes elongation of that part. Thus the shoot appears bent towards light.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In phototropism a plant bends or grows directionally in response to light. Shoots usually move towards the light; roots usually move away from it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-When light is coming from one side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot. This concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the side of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to bend towards light.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Phototropism is the ability of the plant to re-orient the shoot growth towards a direction of light source.
