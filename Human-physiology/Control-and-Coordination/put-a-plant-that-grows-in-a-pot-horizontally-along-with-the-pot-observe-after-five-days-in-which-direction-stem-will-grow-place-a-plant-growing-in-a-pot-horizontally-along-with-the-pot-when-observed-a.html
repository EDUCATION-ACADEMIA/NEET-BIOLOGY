<strong> Put a plant that grows in a pot horizontally along with the pot. Observe after five days. In which direction stem will grow? Place a plant growing in a pot horizontally along with the pot. When observed after 5 days, which side will the stem of the plant grow? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Stem will grow horizontally. The stem grows horizontally 
</p>
<p>(B) Stem won’t show growth 
</p>
<p>(C) ** Stem will grow vertically 
</p>
<p>(D) All the above

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A student placed a potted plant growing in a glass pot horizontally (with the root and shoot, both being in the horizontal direction). After a few days, the student observed that the root of the plant bends downwards and the shoot (stem) of the plant bends upwards.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Root is a part of a plant which is present below the ground. Except for roots, all the parts of a plant like flowers, leaves and fruits grow on stems.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Growing potted plants lets you skip the dirty work of weeding and clearing a soil bed. Start by providing the light and soil conditions that your specific plants prefer. When you’re ready to plant, nestle your plants into the pot, and soak the soil to help them settle into their new home.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Answer: 1) when the plant is kept in a box with a small hole light where the light hits the plants the auxin in that part moves to the opposite side of the plants hence the plant bends towards light. bending of light towards light is called phototropism.
