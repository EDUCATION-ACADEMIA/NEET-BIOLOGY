<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Bile is a fluid that is made and released by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile helps with digestion. It breaks down fats into fatty acids, which can be taken into the body by the digestive tract.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Bile is the greenish-yellow fluid (consisting of waste products, cholesterol, and bile salts) that is secreted by the liver cells to perform 2 primary functions: To carry away waste. To break down fats during digestion.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-bile, also called gall, greenish yellow secretion that is produced in the liver and passed to the gallbladder for concentration, storage, or transport into the first region of the small intestine, the duodenum. Its function is to aid in the digestion of fats in the duodenum.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Your liver continually produces bile. This is a chemical that helps turn fats into energy that your body uses. Bile is necessary for the digestive process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Bile is a physiological aqueous solution produced and secreted by the liver. It consists mainly of bile salts, phospholipids, cholesterol, conjugated bilirubin, electrolytes, and water [1].
