<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Absorption. The simple molecules that result from chemical digestion pass through cell membranes of the lining in the small intestine into the blood or lymph capillaries. This process is called absorption.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Peristalsis also works in this organ, moving food through and mixing it with digestive juices from the pancreas and liver. The duodenum is the first segment of the small intestine. It’s largely responsible for the continuous breaking-down process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-There are 4 steps to digestion: Eat food. Break down the food into tiny pieces. Absorb nutrition into the body: move the small particles out of the digestive system and the rest of the body. Get rid of the waste, which is anything your body can’t use.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-As food passes through the GI tract, it mixes with digestive juices, causing large molecules of food to break down into smaller molecules. The body then absorbs these smaller molecules through the walls of the small intestine into the bloodstream, which delivers them to the rest of the body.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Absorption is the movement of molecules out of the digestive tract and into the circulation or into the lymphatic system. The mechanism by which absorption occurs depends on the type of molecule involved . Molecules pass out of the digestive tract by simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, active transport.
