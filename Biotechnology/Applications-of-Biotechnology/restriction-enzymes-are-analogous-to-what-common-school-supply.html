<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A restriction enzyme acts like molecular scissors, making cuts at the specific sequence of base pairs that it recognizes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Introduction. Restriction enzymes are also called “molecular scissors” as they cleave DNA at or near specific recognition sequences known as restriction sites. These enzymes make one incision on each of the two strands of DNA and are also called restriction endonucleases.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Final answer: Molecular scissor used in genetic engineering is restriction endonuclease.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Molecular scissors, also known as restriction enzymes, They cut genetic material at certain ends and cleave the ends with another or foreign strand using ligases. Restriction enzymes are enzymes that have a specific restriction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Applications of Restriction Enzymes Genetic Engineering: The most popular application of restriction endonucleases is as a tool for genetic engineering. The endonuclease activity enables manipulation of the genome as well as introduction of sequences of interest in the host organism.
