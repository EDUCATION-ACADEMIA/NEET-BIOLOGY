<meta name="description" content="To make a clone, scientists transfer the DNA from an animals somatic cell into an egg cell that has had its nucleus and DNA removed. The egg develops into an embryo that contains the same genes as the cell donor. Then the embryo is implanted into an adult females uterus to grow.The first step in the process of generating embryonic stem cells is to remove the nucleus from an unfertilized egg cell (A).The genetic material of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded, leaving it deprogrammed. What is left is a somatic cell and an enucleated egg cell. These are then fused by inserting the somatic cell into the empty ovum.In SCNT, the egg cells single set of chromosomes is removed. It is replaced by the nucleus from a somatic cell, which already contains two complete sets of chromosomes. So, in the resulting embryo, both sets of chromosomes come from the somatic cell.DNA cloning is the process of making multiple copies of a particular segment of DNA. During this technique, the selected DNA fragment is inserted into a plasmid (the circular piece of DNA) using enzymes. Restriction enzymes and DNA ligase are used in the process.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-To make a clone, scientists transfer the DNA from an animal’s somatic cell into an egg cell that has had its nucleus and DNA removed. The egg develops into an embryo that contains the same genes as the cell donor. Then the embryo is implanted into an adult female’s uterus to grow.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The first step in the process of generating embryonic stem cells is to remove the nucleus from an unfertilized egg cell (A).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The genetic material of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded, leaving it ‘deprogrammed. ‘ What is left is a somatic cell and an enucleated egg cell. These are then fused by inserting the somatic cell into the ‘empty’ ovum.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In SCNT, the egg cell’s single set of chromosomes is removed. It is replaced by the nucleus from a somatic cell, which already contains two complete sets of chromosomes. So, in the resulting embryo, both sets of chromosomes come from the somatic cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-DNA cloning is the process of making multiple copies of a particular segment of DNA. During this technique, the selected DNA fragment is inserted into a plasmid (the circular piece of DNA) using enzymes. Restriction enzymes and DNA ligase are used in the process.
