<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Disease-and drought-resistant plants that require fewer environmental resources (such as water and fertilizer) Less use of pesticides. Increased supply of food with reduced cost and longer shelf life. Faster growing plants and animals.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Fixing mutated genes. Mutated genes that cause disease could be turned off so that they no longer promote disease, or healthy genes that help prevent disease could be turned on so that they could inhibit the disease.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Some benefits of genetic engineering in agriculture are increased crop yields, reduced costs for food or drug production, reduced need for pesticides, enhanced nutrient composition and food quality, resistance to pests and disease, greater food security, and medical benefits to the world’s growing population.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Genetic modification of plants involves adding a specific stretch of DNA into the plant’s genome, giving it new or different characteristics. This could include changing the way the plant grows, or making it resistant to a particular disease.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Third, plant transformation during genetic engineering allows the introduction of new genes into vegetatively propagated crops such as banana (Musa sp.), cassava (Manihot esculenta), and potato (Solanum tuberosum). These features make genetic engineering a powerful tool for enhancing resistance against plant pathogens.
