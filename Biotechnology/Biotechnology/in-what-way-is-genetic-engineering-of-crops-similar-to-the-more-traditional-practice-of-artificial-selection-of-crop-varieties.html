<strong> In what way is genetic engineering of crops similar to the more traditional practice of artificial selection of crop varieties? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** Both methods result in a crop that has some desirable characteristic. 
</p>
<p>(B) Both techniques produce plants that have higher yields than previously. 
</p>
<p>(C) In both cases, two different crop plants are crossed to develop a new one. 
</p>
<p>(D) In both procedures, genes from unrelated organisms can be added to the plant.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Both genetic engineering and artificial selection allow humans to change a species so that its members are better suited for human needs. However, the mechanism for change is different. Artificial selection selects for traits already present in a species, whereas genetic engineering creates new traits.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Conventional breeding relies primarily on selection, using natural processes of sexual and asexual reproduction. Genetic engineering utilizes a process of insertion of genetic material, via a gene gun or other direct gene introduction methods, or by a specially designed bacterial truck, which does not occur in nature.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Selective breeding makes use of existing, naturally present gene variants in a species? and the natural process of breeding. Genetic engineering involves a direct change to an organismâ€™s genome in the laboratory. Gene variants made through genetic engineering can be passed from one generation to the next.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-What are the Similarities Between Artificial Selection and Genetic Engineering? Artificial selection is the most traditional type of genetic engineering. Both allow changing a species in a particular way. These methods are used in agriculture and domestication of animals.
