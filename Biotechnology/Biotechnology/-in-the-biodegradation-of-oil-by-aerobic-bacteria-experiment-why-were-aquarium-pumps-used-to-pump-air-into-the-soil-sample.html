<strong> * In the biodegradation of oil by aerobic bacteria experiment, why were aquarium pumps used to pump air into the soil sample? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Because the air keeps the soil from turning to mud. 
</p>
<p>(B) Because the air keeps the soil dry. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** Because the air provides the oxygen bacteria need to survive.
