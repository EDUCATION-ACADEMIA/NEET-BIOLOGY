<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Genetic engineering (also called genetic modification) is a process that uses laboratory-based technologies to alter the DNA makeup of an organism. This may involve changing a single base pair (A-T or C-G), deleting a region of DNA or adding a new segment of DNA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Gene Transfer: The introduction of new DNA into an existing organismâ€™s cell, usually by vectors such as plasmids and modified viruses. Cells may be modified ex vivo for subsequent administration to humans, or may be altered in vivo by gene therapy given directly to the subject.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A transgenic, or genetically modified, organism is one that has been altered through recombinant DNA technology, which involves either the combining of DNA from different genomes or the insertion of foreign DNA into a genome.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In conjugation, DNA is transferred from one bacterium to another. After the donor cell pulls itself close to the recipient using a structure called a pilus, DNA is transferred between cells. In most cases, this DNA is in the form of a plasmid.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-GMOs, genetically modified organism (or genetically engineered, as they are commonly called in the science world), are the result of tweaking the DNA of a living organism. Gene editing is used for many purposes, one of which is for the creation of GMOs. There are many different, other methods to produce GMOs, however.
