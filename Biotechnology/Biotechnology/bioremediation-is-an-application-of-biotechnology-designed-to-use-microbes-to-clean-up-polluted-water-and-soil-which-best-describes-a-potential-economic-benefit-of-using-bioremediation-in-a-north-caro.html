<strong> Bioremediation is an application of biotechnology designed to use microbes to clean up polluted water and soil. Which best describes a potential economic benefit of using bioremediation in a North Carolina coastal town experiencing the effects of an oil spill? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The cost of purified drinking water will increase, creating additional revenue for the town. 
</p>
<p>(B) The oil from the spill will be recovered in the bioremediation process and can be used as fuel. 
</p>
<p>(C) Large treatment facilities for bioremediation process will be built in the town, creating new jobs. 
</p>
<p>(D) ** Water and land areas will be cleaned of oil, encouraging tourists to continue to visit the town.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The cost of purified drinking water will increase, creating additional revenue for the town. The oil from the spill will be recovered in the bioremediation process and can be used as fuel. Large treatment facilities for bioremediation process will be built in the town, creating new jobs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Biotech crops can make farming more profitable by increasing crop quality and may in some cases increase yields. The use of some of these crops can simplify work and improve safety for farmers. This allows farmers to spend less of their time managing their crops and more time on other profitable activities.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Q. Which best describes a potential economic benefit to the rural areas of North Carolina? Biotechnology can help farmers develop disease-resistant crops.
