<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Gene therapy is a technique that modifies a person’s genes to treat or cure disease. Gene therapies can work by several mechanisms: Replacing a disease-causing gene with a healthy copy of the gene. Inactivating a disease-causing gene that is not functioning properly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-There are basically three types of gene therapy: ex vivo, in vivo, and in situ.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Viruses are currently the most commonly used vectors in gene therapies because they have a natural ability to deliver genetic material into cells. Before a virus can be used to carry therapeutic genes into human cells, it is modified to remove its ability to cause infectious disease.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Gene therapy is when DNA is introduced into a patient to treat a genetic disease. The new DNA usually contains a functioning gene to correct the effects of a disease-causing mutation.

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Gene therapy is of two types. They are somatic gene therapy and germline gene therapy. In somatic gene therapy, we transfer a gene into an ordinary cell of the body. But in germline gene therapy we introduce a gene to a germ cell.
