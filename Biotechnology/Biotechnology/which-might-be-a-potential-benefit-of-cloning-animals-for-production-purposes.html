<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A potential benefit of cloning animals for production purposes could be: To produce uniform products such as chicken drumsticks. Why is biotechnologically produced BST given in supplemental doses to dairy cows? To increase milk production.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Clones allow farmers to upgrade the overall quality of their herds by providing more copies of the best animals in the herd. These animals are then used for conventional breeding, and the sexually reproduced offspring become the food producing animals.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Genes carry the information that determines your traits (say: trates), which are features or characteristics that are passed on to you-or inherited-from your parents. Each cell in the human body contains about 25, 000 to 35, 000 genes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The main energy source for swine is carbohydrates found in cereal grains such as corn, milo, wheat, barley, and their co-products. The feed ingredients which supply carbohydrates/energy in swine diets also make up the largest percentage of the diet and total feed costs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-When genetic information is moved from one cell to another to change the characteristics of the cell, the procedure is known as genetic: engineering. Changing a characteristic by removing and inserting genes into DNA is known as gene: splicing.
