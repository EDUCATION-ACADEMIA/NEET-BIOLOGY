<strong> Treating most diseases involves a certain amount of trial and error, because some drugs or treatments are more effective for some individuals than for others. How could more precise information about variations within the human genome help doctors? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Doctors would be able to tell patients whether or not they would survive a disease based on the patient’s DNA. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** Knowing which drugs or treatments worked best on specific genotypes would help pinpoint treatments more quickly 
</p>
<p>(C) It would allow doctors to alter a patient’s genome so that he or she could be treated more effectively with current drugs. 
</p>
<p>(D) Knowing the patient’s genome would provide information about how long the treatment would take once the correct drug was identified.
