<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Which of the following explains a benefit of using Golden rice in these areas? Golden Rice is bio-engineered and is yellow as a result. Golden Rice allows regions with a low variety of food to receive necessary nutrients.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The answer is option A) Process 1 describes genetic engineering and process 2 describes cloning. In genetic engineering, the DNA of an organism is altered. As in the first process, we are changing the DNA of bacteria by inserting human DNA, it is an example of genetic engineering.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Clones allow farmers to upgrade the overall quality of their herds by providing more copies of the best animals in the herd. These animals are then used for conventional breeding, and the sexually reproduced offspring become the food producing animals.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Which of the following best describes artificial selection as compared to natural selection? In artificial selection, the passing on of traits is determined by survival advantages in nature. In natural selection, the passing on of traits is determined by choices on the part of the organism.
