<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-These are pluripotent (ploo-RIP-uh-tunt) stem cells, meaning they can divide into more stem cells or can become any type of cell in the body. This versatility allows embryonic stem cells to be used to regenerate or repair diseased tissue and organs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Stem cell differentiation involves the changing of a cell to a more specialized cell type, involving a switch from proliferation to specialization. This involves a succession of alterations in cell morphology, membrane potential, metabolic activity and responsiveness to certain signals.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Stem cells are usually found in multicellular organisms and have the unique capacity for self-renewal. They undergo mitotic cell division and can differentiate into different cell types. During embryonic development, stem cells can form cells of all three germ layers such as mesoderm, endoderm, and the ectoderm.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A pluripotent stem cell is one that has the potential to differentiate into any type of human tissue but cannot support the full development of an organism. These cells then become slightly more specialized, and are referred to as multipotent cells.

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-On the basis of their differentiation potential, stem cells can be classified into four types: totipotent, pluripotent, multipotent, and unipotent.
