<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Definition. Genetic engineering (also called genetic modification) is a process that uses laboratory-based technologies to alter the DNA makeup of an organism. This may involve changing a single base pair (A-T or C-G), deleting a region of DNA or adding a new segment of DNA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Genetic engineering: Manipulation of an organism’s genes by introducing, eliminating or rearranging specific genes using the methods of modern molecular biology, particularly those techniques referred to as recombinant DNA techniques.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-recombinant DNA, molecules of DNA from two different species that are inserted into a host organism to produce new genetic combinations that are of value to science, medicine, agriculture, and industry.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Recombinant DNA: DNA which has been altered from its original form by joining genetic material from two different sources. It usually involves putting a gene or part of a gene obtained from one organism into the genome of a different organism.

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Genetic engineering is accomplished in three basic steps. These are (1) The isolation of DNA fragments from a donor organism; (2) The insertion of an isolated donor DNA fragment into a vector genome and (3) The growth of a recombinant vector in an appropriate host.
