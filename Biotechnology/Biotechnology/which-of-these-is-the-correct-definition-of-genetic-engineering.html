<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Definition. Genetic engineering (also called genetic modification) is a process that uses laboratory-based technologies to alter the DNA makeup of an organism. This may involve changing a single base pair (A-T or C-G), deleting a region of DNA or adding a new segment of DNA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A genetically modified organism (GMO) is an animal, plant, or microbe whose DNA has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. For thousands of years, humans have used breeding methods to modify organisms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Genome editing (also called gene editing) is a group of technologies that give scientists the ability to change an organismâ€™s DNA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The resulting molecule is called recombinant DNA. It is recombinant in the sense that it is composed of DNA from two different sources. Thus, it is a type of DNA that would be impossible naturally and is an artifact created by DNA technology.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Genetically engineered (GE) foods have had their DNA changed using genes from other plants or animals. Scientists take the gene for a desired trait in one plant or animal, and they insert that gene into a cell of another plant or animal.
