<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Gene therapy is a technique that modifies a person’s genes to treat or cure disease. Gene therapies can work by several mechanisms: Replacing a disease-causing gene with a healthy copy of the gene. Inactivating a disease-causing gene that is not functioning properly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-To insert new genes directly into cells, scientists use a vehicle called a “vector.” Vectors are genetically engineered to deliver the necessary genes for treating the disease. Vectors need to be able to efficiently deliver genetic material into cells, and there are different kinds of vectors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Gene therapy is used to correct defective genes in order to cure a disease or help your body better fight disease. Researchers are investigating several ways to do this, including: Replacing mutated genes. Some cells become diseased because certain genes work incorrectly or no longer work at all.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Somatic gene therapy: transfer of a section of DNA to any cell of the body that doesn’t produce sperm or eggs. Effects of gene therapy will not be passed onto the patient’s children. Germline gene therapy: transfer of a section of DNA to cells that produce eggs or sperm.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Procedure Details With gene therapy, doctors deliver a healthy copy of a gene to cells inside the body. This healthy gene may replace a damaged (mutated) gene, inactivate a mutated gene or introduce an entirely new gene. Carriers, called vectors, transport these healthy genes into cells.
