<strong> Great strides are being made in identifying genetic markers for disease within the human genome. Which of the following would be considered an ethical misuse of this information? 
</strong>
<p>(A) hospitals using genetic information about specific patients in order to develop treatments for those individuals 
</p>
<p>(B) individuals deciding not to have children based on the results of genetic testing showing they carry the allele for a fatal disease 
</p>
<p>(C) ** insurance companies refusing to insure a person based on information they required about the person’s genome indicating a high risk for a certain disease 
</p>
<p>(D) doctors informing their patients that they are likely to develop a debilitating illness for which there is no treatment based on patient-requested genetic tests

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Ethical issues that arise from modern biotechnologies include the availability and use of privileged information, potential for ecological harm, access to new drugs and treatments, and the idea of interfering with nature.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Looking at all your DNA is called genomic testing. Chromosomes: Chromosomal tests study your chromosomes or long strings of your DNA. They look for changes in the order of genes that could be the cause of a genetic condition. One example of the changes looked for is an extra copy of a chromosome.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The Human Genome Project (HGP) was an international 13-year effort, 1990 to 2003. Primary goals were to discover the complete set of human genes and make them accessible for further biological study, and determine the complete sequence of DNA bases in the human genome.
