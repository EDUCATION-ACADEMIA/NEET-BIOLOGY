<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A gene gun and a virus may both be classified as vectors because they are mechanisms by which foreign DNA may be transferred into a host cell. Transgenic organisms are produced when DNA from another species is inserted into the genome of an organism, which then begins to use the foreign DNA as its own.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The principle of gene gun is to deliver nucleic acids by bombarding target cells with nucleic acid-coated gold particles at high velocity (pressurized inert gas or high-voltage electronic discharge).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The commonly used and most employed vector in gene therapy is the retroviral vector. They are used in both somatic and germline gene therapy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Particle bombardment, or biolistics, is a commonly used method for genetic transformation of plants and other organisms. Millions of DNA-coated metal particles are shot at target cells or tissues using a biolistic device or gene gun.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-To introduce an alien DNA, undifferentiated plant cells are the most suitable host cells for the gene guns. This is so because the undifferentiated plant cells have a cell wall which can be easily broken down by bombarding them with high-velocity micro-particles of gold or tungsten coated with DNA in a gene gun.
