<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-After preliminary experiments in 1973, the Cohen-Boyer team was able to cut open a plasmid loop from one species of bacteria, insert a gene from different bacterial species and close the plasmid. This created a recombinant DNA moleculeâ€“a plasmid containing recombined DNA from two different sources.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Together with Stanley Cohen, Boyer demonstrated the possibility of producing recombinant DNA in bacteria in 1973. This they did by combining a gene for frog ribosomal RNA with a bacterial plasmid which was then put into a strain of E-coli for expression.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer were the first scientists to transplant genes from one living organism to another, a fundamental discovery for genetical engineering. Thousands of products have been developed on the basis of their work, including human growth hormone and hepatitis B vaccine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-typhimurium was used as it contained the antibiotic resistance. Agrobacterium is a gram negative bacterium which is also used in genetic transfer in plants.
</p>
