<strong> In what way did gene therapy, the replacement of a faulty gene with a normal one, stimulate medical research? 
</strong>
<p>(A) New medications had to be developed and tested. 
</p>
<p>(B) The effects of viral DNA had to be studied. 
</p>
<p>(C) The way in which DNA replicates had to be determined.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In what way did gene therapy, the replacement of a faulty gene with a normal one, stimulate medical research? The genes on each chromosome had to be mapped and described. The human genome project mapped out each gene of humans making gene therapy possible.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Gene replacement therapy is the technique of recognizing a faulty gene, applying a piece of DNA in its correct form though a viral vector (known as the carrier molecule) to the gene, thus overriding the identified faulty gene with the correct copy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Gene therapies can work by several mechanisms: Replacing a disease-causing gene with a healthy copy of the gene. Inactivating a disease-causing gene that is not functioning properly. Introducing a new or modified gene into the body to help treat a disease.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-With gene therapy, doctors deliver a healthy copy of a gene to cells inside the body. This healthy gene may replace a damaged (mutated) gene, inactivate a mutated gene or introduce an entirely new gene. Carriers, called vectors, transport these healthy genes into cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Gene therapy is of two types. They are somatic gene therapy and germline gene therapy. In somatic gene therapy, we transfer a gene into an ordinary cell of the body. But in germline gene therapy we introduce a gene to a germ cell.
