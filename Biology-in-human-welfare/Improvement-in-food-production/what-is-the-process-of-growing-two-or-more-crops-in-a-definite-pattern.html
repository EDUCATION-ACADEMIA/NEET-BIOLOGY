<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Mixed cropping involves growing of two crops growing on the same agricultural land. Inter-cropping also involves the growing of different crops simultaneously on a single land in a definite pattern. Therefore Inter-cropping could be called as a type of mixed cropping.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Mixed cropping, also known as multiple cropping, is similar to intercropping and involves growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of land. This type of cropping method can improve the fertility of the soil and increase crop yield.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Summary. Intercropping is the practice of growing two or more crops in proximity. The most common goal of intercropping is to produce a greater yield on a given piece of land by making use of resources that would otherwise not be utilized by a single crop.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Inter-Cropping – Growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same field is called intercropping.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Intercropping is the practice of growing more than one crop on the same field at the same time in a definite row pattern. After one row of the main crop, three rows of intercrops can be grown. This increases productivity per unit area.
