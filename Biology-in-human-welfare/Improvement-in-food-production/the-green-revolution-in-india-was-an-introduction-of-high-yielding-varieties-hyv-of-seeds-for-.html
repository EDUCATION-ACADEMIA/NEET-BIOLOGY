The Green Revolution in India was initiated in the 1960s by introducing high-yielding varieties of rice and wheat to increase food production in order to alleviate hunger and poverty.During the Green Revolution in the 1960s, Indian farmers cultivated wheat and rice using high yielding variety (HYV) seeds, irrigation, chemical fertilisers, insecticides, pesticides, and more.
