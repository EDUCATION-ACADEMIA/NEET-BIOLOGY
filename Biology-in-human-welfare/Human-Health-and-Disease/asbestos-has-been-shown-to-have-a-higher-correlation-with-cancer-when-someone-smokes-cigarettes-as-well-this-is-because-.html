<strong> Asbestos has been shown to have a higher correlation with cancer when someone smokes cigarettes as well. This is because ____ 
</strong>
<p>(A) both substances are teratogens 
</p>
<p>(B) ** the synergistic effect that results from exposure to both at the same time 
</p>
<p>(C) Asbestos is a carcinogen and tobacco is an endocrine disruptor 
</p>
<p>(D) the risk-taking behavior of the individual exposed

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Over time, inhalation of asbestos fibers causes scarring and inflammation of the lung tissue. Researchers believe that smokers have an elevated risk of asbestosis because smokers’ lungs are already damaged from cigarettes and face additional scarring and irritation from the toxic fibers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Cigarette smoking is another known cause of lung cancer. However, the combination of asbestos exposure and smoking is far more likely to cause lung cancer than either factor by itself. This is known as the ‘synergistic effect of asbestos exposure and cigarette smoking.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Smoking and Asbestosis According to research by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, smoking increases the risk of asbestosis among those exposed to asbestos. Asbestosis is a chronic pulmonary disease in which the lungs undergo slow and repetitive scarring, or fibrosis. There is no known cure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Asbestos exposure alone increases lung cancer mortality among nonsmokers and adds to smoking-associated lung cancer risk. Asbestosis further increases the lung cancer risk and, considered jointly with smoking, has a supra-additive effect. Insulators benefit greatly by quitting smoking.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Inhalation of asbestos fibers has been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer in many studies of asbestos-exposed workers. This increased risk is seen with all forms of asbestos (there is no “safe” type of asbestos in terms of lung cancer risk).
