<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Support your answer with evidence from the text. example, students may identify Heliobacter pylori as a species of bacteria that helps protect people. Studies suggest that it helps prevent “asthma, allergies, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and esophageal cancer."
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The number of normal bacterial cells that live on the body is in the region of 100 million. This number is 10 times greater than the 10 million cells that make up the human body.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The human body contains trillions of microorganisms-outnumbering human cells by 10 to 1. Because of their small size, however, microorganisms make up only about 1 to 3 percent of the body’s mass (in a 200-pound adult, that’s 2 to 6 pounds of bacteria), but play a vital role in human health.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The vast majority of the bacteria reside in the colon, with previous estimates of about 1014 bacteria [2], followed by the skin, which is estimated to harbor  1012 bacteria [9].
