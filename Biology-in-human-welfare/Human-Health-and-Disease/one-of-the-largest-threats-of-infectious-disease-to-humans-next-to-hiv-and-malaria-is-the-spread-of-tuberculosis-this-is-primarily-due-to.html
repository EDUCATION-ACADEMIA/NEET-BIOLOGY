<strong> One of the largest threats of infectious disease to humans next to HIV and malaria is the spread of Tuberculosis. This is primarily due to 
</strong>
<p>(A) the overuse of vaccinations in treating people infected with TB 
</p>
<p>(B) ** increased urbanization coupled with too few screening and control programs 
</p>
<p>(C) identifying people with chronic coughs that may be active carriers 
</p>
<p>(D) quarantining people who have an incurable form of TB

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Emerging infectious diseases are infections that have recently appeared within a population or those whose incidence or geographic range is rapidly increasing or threatens to increase in the near future.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Influences of urbanization on selected infectious diseases. Rapid increase in slums leads to poor access to clean water and sanitation. Diarrheal disease is still the most common cause of death in children under 5 years. Reliance on large agribusinesses can lead to wide-spread outbreaks of food-borne illness.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-HIV, tuberculosis (TB) and malaria are diseases of poverty and marginalization, with a heavy toll among populations that are chronically disadvantaged.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The increasing density of buildings caused by land urbanization increases the risk of the spread of infectious diseases. Moreover, the impact of urbanization on the spread of infectious diseases has regional heterogeneity.
