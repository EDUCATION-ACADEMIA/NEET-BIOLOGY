<title>VOCAB:The average number of children a female member of a population has during her lifetime
</title>
<meta name="description" content="The single most important factor in population growth is the total fertility rate (TFR). If, on average, women give birth to 2.1 children and these children survive to the age of 15, any given woman will have replaced herself and her partner upon death. A TFR of 2.1 is known as the replacement rate.The most commonly used metric is the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) – or often simply fertility rate – which measures the average number of children per woman. The global average fertility rate is around 2.3 children per woman today.It is expressed as children per woman. Total fertility rate is directly calculated as the sum of age-specific fertility rates (usually referring to women aged 15 to 49 years), or five times the sum if data are given in five-year age groups.One study estimated a woman can have around 15-30 children in a lifetime, taking pregnancy and recovery time into account. Since men require less time and fewer resources to have kids, the most prolific fathers today can have up to about 200 children.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The single most important factor in population growth is the total fertility rate (TFR). If, on average, women give birth to 2.1 children and these children survive to the age of 15, any given woman will have replaced herself and her partner upon death. A TFR of 2.1 is known as the replacement rate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The most commonly used metric is the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) – or often simply ‘fertility rate’ – which measures the average number of children per woman. The global average fertility rate is around 2.3 children per woman today.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-It is expressed as children per woman. Total fertility rate is directly calculated as the sum of age-specific fertility rates (usually referring to women aged 15 to 49 years), or five times the sum if data are given in five-year age groups.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-One study estimated a woman can have around 15-30 children in a lifetime, taking pregnancy and recovery time into account. Since men require less time and fewer resources to have kids, the most “prolific” fathers today can have up to about 200 children.
