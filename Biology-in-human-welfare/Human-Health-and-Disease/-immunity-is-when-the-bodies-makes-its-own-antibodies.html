<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Active Immunity results when exposure to a disease organism triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to that disease. Active immunity can be acquired through natural immunity or vaccine-induced immunity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Vaccine-induced immunity Also known as artificial active immunity, a person can build resistance to a disease following an immunization. Immunization is the process that happens in the body following the administration of a vaccine aimed at conferring immunity to a pathogen.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Adaptive immunity: Adaptive (or active) immunity develops throughout our lives. We develop adaptive immunity when we’re exposed to diseases or when we’re immunized against them with vaccines. Passive immunity: Passive immunity is “borrowed” from another source and it lasts for a short time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The acquired immune system, with help from the innate system, makes special proteins (called antibodies) to protect your body from a specific invader. These antibodies are developed by cells called B lymphocytes after the body has been exposed to the invader.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-(ih-MYOO-nih-tee) In medicine, the immune system’s way of protecting the body against an infectious disease. The three types of immunity are innate, adaptive, and passive. Innate immunity includes barriers, such as skin and mucous membranes, that keep harmful substances from entering the body.
