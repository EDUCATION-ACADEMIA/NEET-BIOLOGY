<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A person can get cholera by drinking water or eating food contaminated with cholera bacteria. In an epidemic, the source of the contamination is usually the feces of an infected person that contaminates water or food. The disease can spread rapidly in areas with inadequate treatment of sewage and drinking water.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Cholera transmission is closely linked to inadequate access to clean water and sanitation facilities. Typical at-risk areas include peri-urban slums, and camps for internally displaced persons or refugees, where minimum requirements of clean water and sanitation are not been met.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Contaminated water supplies are the main source of cholera infection. The bacterium can be found in: Surface or well water. Contaminated public wells are frequent sources of large-scale cholera outbreaks.
</p>
