<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Emerging infectious diseases are infections that have recently appeared within a population or those whose incidence or geographic range is rapidly increasing or threatens to increase in the near future. Emerging infections can be caused by: Previously undetected or unknown infectious agents.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Emerging infectious diseases can be defined as infectious diseases that have newly appeared in a population or have existed but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range, or that are caused by one of the NIAID Category A, B, or C priority pathogens.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A disease outbreak is endemic when it is consistently present but limited to a particular region. This makes the disease spread and rates predictable. Malaria, for example, is considered endemic in certain countries and regions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Abstract. PIP: Emerging infectious diseases are diseases of infectious origin whose incidence in humans has increased within the past decades or threatens to increase in the near future. The reappearance of a previously known infection after a period of disappearance or decline in incidence is known as re-emergence.
