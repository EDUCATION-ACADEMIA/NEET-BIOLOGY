<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-An antigen is any substance that causes your immune system to produce antibodies against it. This means your immune system does not recognize the substance, and is trying to fight it off. An antigen may be a substance from the environment, such as chemicals, bacteria, viruses, or pollen.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-antigen, substance that is capable of stimulating an immune response, specifically activating lymphocytes, which are the bodyâ€™s infection-fighting white blood cells. In general, two main divisions of antigens are recognized: foreign antigens (or heteroantigens) and autoantigens (or self-antigens).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-When the body senses foreign substances (called antigens), the immune system works to recognize the antigens and get rid of them. B lymphocytes are triggered to make antibodies (also called immunoglobulins). These proteins lock onto specific antigens.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Antibodies are protective proteins produced by your immune system. They attach to antigens (foreign substances)-such as bacteria, fungi, viruses and toxins-and remove them from your body.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-d) all of these. The ability of antigen to stimulate antibody production is called. a) affinity.
