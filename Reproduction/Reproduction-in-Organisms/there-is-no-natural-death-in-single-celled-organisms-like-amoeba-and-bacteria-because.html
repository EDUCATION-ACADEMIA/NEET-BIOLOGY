<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-There is no natural death in single-celled organisms like Amoeba and bacteria. It is so, because of asexual reproduction, the body of the parent cell is divided into daughter cells. So, in effect, there is no practical death in Amoeba and bacteria.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-There is no natural death in single-celled organisms like and bacteria because. The parental body is distributed among the offspring.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The single celled organisms reproduce asexually by dividing itself into two new daughter cells. This way the genetic material and cellular contents of the parent cell get distributed among two daughter cells. This makes the parent cell survive without natural death in subsequent generations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The ‘immortal’ jellyfish, Turritopsis dohrnii To date, there’s only one species that has been called ‘biologically immortal’: the jellyfish Turritopsis dohrnii. These small, transparent animals hang out in oceans around the world and can turn back time by reverting to an earlier stage of their life cycle.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-For many single-celled organisms, reproduction is a similar process. The parent cell simply divides to form two daughter cells that are identical to the parent. In many other organisms, two parents are involved, and the offspring are not identical to the parents. In fact, each offspring is unique.
