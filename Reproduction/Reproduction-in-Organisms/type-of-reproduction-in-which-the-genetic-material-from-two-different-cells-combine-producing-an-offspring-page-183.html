<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Sexual reproduction is combining genetic material from two parents, usually from two gametes. How the two cells combine may take many forms, but does not necessarily involve physical contact. Sexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically distinct from other offspring and from their parents.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The process in which two gametes unite is called fertilization. The fertilized cell that results is referred to as a zygote. A zygote is diploid cell, which means that it has twice the number of chromosomes as a gamete.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-While asexual reproduction produces clones of the parent organism with no genetic variation in their offspring, the offspring produced through sexual reproduction have a combination of characteristics from both parents and are genetically different from those parents. So they tend to have a high genetic variation.
