<meta name="description" content="Meiosis I and meiosis II are the two divisions of the process, and each include numerous stages. Meiosis is a kind of cell division utilised to produce gametes, such as sperm or egg cells, in sexually reproducing organisms.There are two divisions in meiosis; the first division is meiosis I: the number of cells is doubled but the number of chromosomes is not. This results in 1/2 as many chromosomes per cell. The second division is meiosis II: this division is like mitosis; the number of chromosomes does not get reduced.Mitosis is the process in which a eukaryotic cell nucleus splits in two, followed by division of the parent cell into two daughter cells. The word mitosis means threads, and it refers to the threadlike appearance of chromosomes as the cell prepares to divide.Finally, unlike mitosis, meiosis involves two rounds of nuclear division, not just one. Despite this fact, many of the other events of meiosis are similar to those that occur in mitosis.Because the chromosome number of a species remains the same from one generation to the next, the chromosome number of germ cells must be reduced by half during meiosis. To accomplish this feat, meiosis, unlike mitosis, involves a single round of DNA replication followed by two rounds of cell division (Figure 1).">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Meiosis I and meiosis II are the two divisions of the process, and each include numerous stages. Meiosis is a kind of cell division utilised to produce gametes, such as sperm or egg cells, in sexually reproducing organisms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-There are two divisions in meiosis; the first division is meiosis I: the number of cells is doubled but the number of chromosomes is not. This results in 1/2 as many chromosomes per cell. The second division is meiosis II: this division is like mitosis; the number of chromosomes does not get reduced.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Mitosis is the process in which a eukaryotic cell nucleus splits in two, followed by division of the parent cell into two daughter cells. The word “mitosis” means “threads, ” and it refers to the threadlike appearance of chromosomes as the cell prepares to divide.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Finally, unlike mitosis, meiosis involves two rounds of nuclear division, not just one. Despite this fact, many of the other events of meiosis are similar to those that occur in mitosis.
