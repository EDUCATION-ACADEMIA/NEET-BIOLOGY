<title>How similar is sexual reproduction in flowering plants and in humans?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Sexual reproduction is similar in both plants and animals because it involves the fertilization of a female gamete by a male gamete in both organisms. A gamete is a sex cell that contains half the genetic information as somatic cells, which are all of the other cells in the body.The Ovule is like the egg in animals and once fertilization has taken place will become the seed. This is the flowers attachment to the stalk and in some cases becomes part of the fruit after fertilization e.g. strawberry. Gives support to the flower and elevates the flower for the insects.In sexual reproduction new organisms are produced from the fusion of a male sex cell with a female sex cell. This fusion of gametes is called fertilisation. Sex cells are also known as gametes.Flowering plants reproduce sexually through a process called pollination. Flowers contain male sex organs called stamens and female sex organs called pistils. The anther is the part of the stamen that contains pollen. Pollen contains the male gametes.">

<strong> How similar is sexual reproduction in flowering plants and in humans? 
</strong>
<p>(A) It involves the fusion of pollen grain and sperm. 
</p>
<p>(B) It involves the fusion of ovaries and ovules. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** It involves the fusion of male and female reproductive cells. 
</p>
<p>(D) It does not involve any fusion of male and female reproductive cells. 
</p>
<p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Sexual reproduction is similar in both plants and animals because it involves the fertilization of a female gamete by a male gamete in both organisms. A gamete is a sex cell that contains half the genetic information as somatic cells, which are all of the other cells in the body.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The Ovule is like the egg in animals and once fertilization has taken place will become the seed. This is the flowerâ€™s attachment to the stalk and in some cases becomes part of the fruit after fertilization e.g. strawberry. Gives support to the flower and elevates the flower for the insects.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In sexual reproduction new organisms are produced from the fusion of a male sex cell with a female sex cell. This fusion of gametes is called fertilisation. Sex cells are also known as gametes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Flowering plants reproduce sexually through a process called pollination. Flowers contain male sex organs called stamens and female sex organs called pistils. The anther is the part of the stamen that contains pollen. Pollen contains the male gametes.
