<meta name="description" content="Fertilisation occurs when a sperm fuses with the female act during intercourse and further forms an egg that gets implanted in uterus of the female. The sperm travels through the fallopian tube and penetrates the zona pellucida layer of the ovum (female egg) and fuses with it which forms zygote (fertilized egg).In humans, fertilization takes place in females, in the oviduct or the fallopian tube. For fertilization, the motile sperm moves towards the egg and fuses to form the zygote. Thus, the correct answer is option D.Conception happens when sperm fertilizes the egg. Once conception occurs, your provider places the created embryo inside the uterus that will carry the pregnancy for implantation.When sperms come in contact with an egg, one of the sperms may fuse with the egg. Such fusion of the egg and the sperm is called fertilization. During fertilization, the nuclei of the sperm and the egg fuse to form a single nucleus. This results in the formation of a fertilized egg or zygote.Meiosis is a process where a single cell divides twice to produce four cells containing half the original amount of genetic information. These cells are our sex cells – sperm in males, eggs in females.">

<strong> Which of the following correctly describes sexual reproduction in humans? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Fertilisation of the egg takes place inside the male’s body. 
</p>
<p>(B) Many eggs are fertilised by one sperm. 
</p>
<p>(C) The fertilised egg develops in the stomach. 
</p>
<p>(D) ** Fertilisation occurs when a sperm and an egg fuse. 
</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Fertilisation occurs when a sperm fuses with the female act during intercourse and further forms an egg that gets implanted in uterus of the female. The sperm travels through the fallopian tube and penetrates the zona pellucida layer of the ovum (female egg) and fuses with it which forms zygote (fertilized egg).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In humans, fertilization takes place in females, in the oviduct or the fallopian tube. For fertilization, the motile sperm moves towards the egg and fuses to form the zygote. Thus, the correct answer is option D.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Conception happens when sperm fertilizes the egg. Once conception occurs, your provider places the created embryo inside the uterus that will carry the pregnancy for implantation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-When sperms come in contact with an egg, one of the sperms may fuse with the egg. Such fusion of the egg and the sperm is called fertilization. During fertilization, the nuclei of the sperm and the egg fuse to form a single nucleus. This results in the formation of a fertilized egg or zygote.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Meiosis is a process where a single cell divides twice to produce four cells containing half the original amount of genetic information. These cells are our sex cells – sperm in males, eggs in females.
