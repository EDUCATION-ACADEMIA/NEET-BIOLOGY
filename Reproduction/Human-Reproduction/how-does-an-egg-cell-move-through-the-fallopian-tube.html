<title>How does an egg cell move through the fallopian tube?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="The luminal cells of the fallopian tubes have cilia (hair-like structures) on their surfaces, and by the ciliary movement of these small hair-like structures a flow is created directed from the ovary to the uterus. This important flow carries the eggs from the ovary toward the uterus.Egg Transport Adhesive sites on the cilia, which are located on the surface of the fimbriae, are responsible for egg pickup and movement into the tube. The cilia within the tube, and muscular contractions resulting from the movement of the egg, create a forward motion. Transport through the tube takes about 30 hours.The main function of ciliated cells in the fallopian tube is to transport the ovum from the ovary toward the uterus and help to remove genotoxic stress after ovulation [34, 35].Simple columnar ciliated is one type of epithelium that lines the fallopian tubes. Movements of the cilia help to move the egg to the uterus. The cilia at the end of the fallopian tube nearest the ovary, picks up and transports ovulated eggs, called oocytes, to the widest part of the fallopian tube called the ampulla, in the middle of the fallopian tube.">

<strong> How does an egg cell move through the fallopian tube? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Via diffusion 
</p>
<p>(B) ** Ciliated epithelial cells move it along 
</p>
<p>(C) Via gas exchange 
</p>
<p>(D) It drifts through the liquid in the fallopian tube

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The luminal cells of the fallopian tubes have cilia (hair-like structures) on their surfaces, and by the ciliary movement of these small hair-like structures a flow is created directed from the ovary to the uterus. This important flow carries the eggs from the ovary toward the uterus.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Egg Transport Adhesive sites on the cilia, which are located on the surface of the fimbriae, are responsible for egg pickup and movement into the tube. The cilia within the tube, and muscular contractions resulting from the movement of the egg, create a forward motion. Transport through the tube takes about 30 hours.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The main function of ciliated cells in the fallopian tube is to transport the ovum from the ovary toward the uterus and help to remove genotoxic stress after ovulation [34, 35].
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Simple columnar ciliated is one type of epithelium that lines the fallopian tubes. Movements of the cilia help to move the egg to the uterus.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-â€™ The cilia at the end of the fallopian tube nearest the ovary, picks up and transports ovulated eggs, called oocytes, to the widest part of the fallopian tube called the ampulla, in the middle of the fallopian tube.
