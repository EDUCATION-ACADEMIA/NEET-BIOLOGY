<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Water lily and sunflower are examples of insect-pollinated plants. Wind pollination occurs in plants that produce light-coloured blooms with no nice odour and pollen grains that are smaller and lighter in weight. Water hyacinth, grasses, and cereal crops are among the plants pollinated by the wind.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Anemophily or wind pollination is pollination carried out with the help of the wind. This pollination is called anemophilous pollination.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The flowers of water hyacinth and water lily emerge above the level of water and are pollinated by insects or wind.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Geitonogamy is a kind of self-pollination in which pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the stigma between flowers on the same plant. Ans. Plants that are pollinated by water are called aquatic. Pollen floats on the surface of the water, drifting until it comes into contact with flowers.

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Anemophily is the process when pollen is transported by air currents from one individual plant to another. About 12% of the worldâ€™s flowering plants are wind-pollinated, including grasses and cereal crops, many trees, and the infamous allergenic ragweeds.
