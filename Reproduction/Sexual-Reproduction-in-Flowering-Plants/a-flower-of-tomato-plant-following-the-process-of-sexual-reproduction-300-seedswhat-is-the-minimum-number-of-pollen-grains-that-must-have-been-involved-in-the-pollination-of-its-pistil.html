<title>A flower of tomato plant following the process of sexual reproduction 300 seeds.What is the minimum number of pollen grains that must have been involved in the pollination of its pistil?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="The minimum number of pollen grains that might be involved are 240, as 240 viable seeds are formed. This is because each pollen grain contains 2 male gametes, out of which one fuses with egg forming zygote that gives rise to seeds.(c) The minimum number of pollen grains to land under the pollination stigma is 360 and there are two male gametes in each pollen grain. One fuses with polar nuclei and forms endosperm from these two gametes, while the other male gamete fuses with the egg cell to create the zygote that finally gives birth to the seeds.Thus, for fertilization of one ovule, a minimum one pollen grain with two male gametes and one egg (female gamete) are involved. Thus, for the production of 200 seeds, a minimum of 200 pollen grains and 600 gametes (400 male gametes and 200 female gametes) are needed.(a) The number of ovules minimally involved in this process would be 200 as the number of viable seeds are 200. After fertilisation, the ovary turns into a fruit and the ovule turn into a seed.Therefore, for the formation of 200 pollen grains 50 meiosis in 50 microspore mother cells are required (2004=50 ). However, when one diploid megaspore mother cell divides by meiosis, it also forms 4 linearly arranged hapolid megaspore, out of which 3 degenerate and only 1 megaspore develops into egg.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The minimum number of pollen grains that might be involved are 240, as 240 viable seeds are formed. This is because each pollen grain contains 2 male gametes, out of which one fuses with egg forming zygote that gives rise to seeds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-(c) The minimum number of pollen grains to land under the pollination stigma is 360 and there are two male gametes in each pollen grain. One fuses with polar nuclei and forms endosperm from these two gametes, while the other male gamete fuses with the egg cell to create the zygote that finally gives birth to the seeds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Thus, for fertilization of one ovule, a minimum one pollen grain with two male gametes and one egg (female gamete) are involved. Thus, for the production of 200 seeds, a minimum of 200 pollen grains and 600 gametes (400 male gametes and 200 female gametes) are needed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-(a) The number of ovules minimally involved in this process would be 200 as the number of viable seeds are 200. After fertilisation, the ovary turns into a fruit and the ovule turn into a seed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Therefore, for the formation of 200 pollen grains 50 meiosis in 50 microspore mother cells are required (2004=50 ). However, when one diploid megaspore mother cell divides by meiosis, it also forms 4 linearly arranged hapolid megaspore, out of which 3 degenerate and only 1 megaspore develops into egg.
