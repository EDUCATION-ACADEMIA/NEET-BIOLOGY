<strong> How can a person’s muscle cells have the same exact DNA sequences as their nerve cells even though the look and perform completely different? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The two different cells become mutated 
</p>
<p>(B) ** The proteins expressed in each cell are different 
</p>
<p>(C) They actually have different DNA in the two types of cells. 
</p>
<p>(D) The genome of the different cells changes 
</p>
<p>
<div style ="text-align:center">
<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Gene regulation is how a cell controls which genes, out of the many genes in its genome, are “turned on” (expressed). Thanks to gene regulation, each cell type in your body has a different set of active genes – despite the fact that almost all the cells of your body contain the exact same DNA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-These cells are different because they use the same set of genes differently. So even though each of our cells has the same 20, 000 or so genes, each cell can select which ones it wants to “turn on” and which ones it wants to keep “turned off”.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Although all cells contain the same DNA sequence, muscle cells are different from nerve cells and other types of cells because of the different genes that are turned on in these cells and the different RNAs and proteins produced.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-What causes DNA instructions to make a muscle cell instead of a nerve cell? The muscle cell and nerve cell inherit different DNA sequences. Transcription of different genes leads to the synthesis of different proteins in the two cell types.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-All the cells of higher organisms have the same DNA but not the same proteins. Each type of specialised cell that forms a tissue has its own pattern of gene expression and, consequently, it contains a particular set of proteins that determine its function.
