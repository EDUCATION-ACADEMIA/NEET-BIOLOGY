<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In predation, one organism kills and consumes another. Predation provides energy to prolong the life and promote the reproduction of the organism that does the killing, the predator, to the detriment of the organism being consumed, the prey. Predation influences organisms at two ecological levels.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Predation: A predator is any consumer that kills and eats another living organism in order to obtain energy. The organism being eaten is called prey. Examples are Lions, Wolves, and Eagles.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A community is an area in which two or more populations of different species occupy. For instance, within a forest, there are species of squirrels, deer, rabbits, and other animals that inhabit that area. This would be considered a community.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Herbivory is the act of eating plants. Herbivory occurs above and below ground. Herbivores may eat any part of the plant above the soil including leaves, stems, flowers, fruit and any part of the plant below the soil including roots and tubers.
