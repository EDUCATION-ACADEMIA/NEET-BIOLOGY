<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The main direct causes of extinction are loss and degradation of habitats due to human use of land and sea; overexploitation of wild populations; and the impacts on populations and ecological communities of invasive alien species, pollution, and climate change14, 16 and 17.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Habitat loss is the primary cause of higher extinction rates. Other causes include habitat changes, over-exploitation of wildlife for commercial purposes, the introduction of harmful nonnative species, pollution, and the spread of diseases.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Pollution – Pollution is a major reason behind the declining wildlife. The contamination of the natural habitat of the organisms is causing their rapid extinction. Oil spills, water pollution, acid rain, and soil contamination have been devastating for many species of fish and birds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The largest extinction in Earth’s history marked the end of the Permian period, some 252 million years ago. Long before dinosaurs, our planet was populated with plants and animals that were mostly obliterated after a series of massive volcanic eruptions in Siberia.
