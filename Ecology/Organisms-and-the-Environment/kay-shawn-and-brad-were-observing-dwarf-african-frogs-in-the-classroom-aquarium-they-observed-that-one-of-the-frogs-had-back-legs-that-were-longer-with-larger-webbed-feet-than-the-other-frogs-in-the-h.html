<strong> Kay, Shawn, and Brad were observing dwarf African frogs in the classroom aquarium. They observed that one of the frogs had back legs that were longer with larger webbed feet than the other frogs in the habitat. How does the difference in the size of one frogâ€™s back legs give it an advantage over the other frogs? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The frog will be able to live longer than the other frogs. 
</p>
<p>(B) The other frogs of the same kind will not accept the larger frog. 
</p>
<p>(C) The frog will soon get too big and have to move to a new habitat. 
</p>
<p>(D) ** The frog will be able to move faster to get food and escape danger.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The given statement is true. Frogs have strong back legs to jump on land and webbed feet to swim in water.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Skin that prevents loss of water. Eyelids that allow them to adapt to vision outside of the water. An eardrum developed to separate the external ear from the middle ear.
</p>
