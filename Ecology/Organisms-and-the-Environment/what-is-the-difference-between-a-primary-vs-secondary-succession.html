<meta name="description" content="In primary succession, newly exposed or newly formed rock is colonized by living things for the first time. In secondary succession, an area previously occupied by living things is disturbed-disrupted-then recolonized following the disturbance.Secondary succession is more common and usually occurs faster than primary succession because the substrate is already present. Secondary succession occurs on a surface where an ecosystem has previously existed. This happens after some sort of disturbance.Primary succession is a slower process than secondary succession.Timeline: Primary succession does not have a previous ecological community, and therefore, building one from the very beginning will take a longer time. However, secondary succession builds up from a previously inhabited area with enriched soil; therefore, its development takes a shorter time.Some examples of primary succession include the formation of a new ecosystem after a volcano, glacier outbursts, or a nuclear explosion. Some examples of secondary succession include succession after fire, harvesting, logging, or abandonment of land or the renewal after a disease outbreak.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In primary succession, newly exposed or newly formed rock is colonized by living things for the first time. In secondary succession, an area previously occupied by living things is disturbed-disrupted-then recolonized following the disturbance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Secondary succession is more common and usually occurs faster than primary succession because the substrate is already present. Secondary succession occurs on a surface where an ecosystem has previously existed. This happens after some sort of disturbance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Primary succession is a slower process than secondary succession.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Timeline: Primary succession does not have a previous ecological community, and therefore, building one from the very beginning will take a longer time. However, secondary succession builds up from a previously inhabited area with enriched soil; therefore, its development takes a shorter time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Some examples of primary succession include the formation of a new ecosystem after a volcano, glacier outbursts, or a nuclear explosion. Some examples of secondary succession include succession after fire, harvesting, logging, or abandonment of land or the renewal after a disease outbreak.
