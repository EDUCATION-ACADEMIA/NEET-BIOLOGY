Adaption refers to the behavioral or physical attributes of an animal that helps them survive better in its ecosystem.In natural selection, genetic mutations that are beneficial to an individuals survival are passed on through reproduction. This results in a new generation of organisms that are more likely to survive to reproduce.An adaptation can be structural, meaning it is a physical part of the organism. An adaptation can also be behavioral, affecting the way an organism responds to its environment. An example of a structural adaptation is the way some plants have adapted to life in dry, hot deserts.adaptation, in biology, the process by which a species becomes fitted to its environment; it is the result of natural selections acting upon heritable variation over several generations.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Evolutionary adaptation, or simply adaptation, is the adjustment of organisms to their environment in order to improve their chances at survival in that environment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-“Adaptation is defined as the process where a species or an organism gradually becomes better acclimated to its environment.” Adaption refers to the behavioral or physical attributes of an animal that helps them survive better in its ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In natural selection, genetic mutations that are beneficial to an individual’s survival are passed on through reproduction. This results in a new generation of organisms that are more likely to survive to reproduce.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-An adaptation can be structural, meaning it is a physical part of the organism. An adaptation can also be behavioral, affecting the way an organism responds to its environment. An example of a structural adaptation is the way some plants have adapted to life in dry, hot deserts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-adaptation, in biology, the process by which a species becomes fitted to its environment; it is the result of natural selection’s acting upon heritable variation over several generations.
