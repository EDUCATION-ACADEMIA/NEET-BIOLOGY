<strong> The Texas Mock Orange is a type of flowering plant that is only found growing naturally in Texas. Which of the following is the most likely reason that they only grow naturally in Texas? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The type of animals that eat the Texas Mock Orange are not found in other environments. 
</p>
<p>(B) The amount of sunlight the Texas Mock Orange needs is not found in other environments. 
</p>
<p>(C) The type and amount of water the Texas Mock Orange needs is not found in other environments. 
</p>
<p>(D) ** The types of organisms that pollinate and help the Texas Mock Orange reproduce are not found in other environments.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The Texas Mock Orange is a type of flowering plant that is only found growing naturally in Texas. Which of the following is the most likely reason that they only grow naturally in Texas? The types of organisms that pollinate and help the Texas Mock Orange reproduce are not found in other environments.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The coral reef would begin to deteriorate without the variety of fish and plants necessary to maintain balance. The waters surrounding the coral reef will become cool with the decreasing number of organisms living there.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If the grasses in each ecosystem are attacked or killed by a disease, which ecosystem will most likely survive? The prairie food web, because there is a variety of producers. Prairie food web has only grass as a producer and the tundra food web has moss, grass and lichen as producers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-So, the correct answer is ‘Tropical Rainforest’.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Since some uninhabited land may have thin, poor quality soils with few nutrients, pioneer species are often hardy plants with adaptations such as long roots, root nodes containing nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and leaves that employ transpiration.
