<title>Which of these environments is most likely to experience the arrival of a pioneer species?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Answer and Explanation: The correct answer is c. lichens. Lichens are most likely to be pioneer species in a newly formed volcanic island.Pioneer species, such as lichen and moss inhabit an area after a major disturbance, such as volcanic eruption. Over time, other species are found in the disturbed area, and the number of pioneer species decreases.The term pioneer species is also used to refer to the first species, usually plants, to return to an area after disturbance as part of the process of secondary succession. Disturbances may include floods, tornadoes, forest fires, deforestation, or clearing by other means.A pioneer community is the first community of organisms that occurs in a previously ecologically barren area. Plants in a pioneer community typically have short lifespans because the environment has such few resources for them to survive.Pioneer species prepare an area for other species in two ways. First, they break down rocks in primary succession, allowing later plant species to put down roots. Second, pioneer species often grow quickly and die back each year, adding organic matter to the soil they create by breaking down rocks.">
