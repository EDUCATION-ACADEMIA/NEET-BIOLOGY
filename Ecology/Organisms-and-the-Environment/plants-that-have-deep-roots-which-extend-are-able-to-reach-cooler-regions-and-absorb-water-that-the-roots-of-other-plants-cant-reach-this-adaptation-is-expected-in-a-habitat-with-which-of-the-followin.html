<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Xerosere is a plant succession that is limited by water availability. It includes the different stages in a xerarch succession. Xerarch succession of ecological communities originated in extremely dry situation such as sand deserts, sand dunes, salt deserts, rock deserts etc.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The first organisms to appear in areas of primary succession are often mosses or lichens. These organisms are known as pioneer species because they are the first species present; pioneer species must be hardy and strong, just like human pioneers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The process of ecological changes that establishes a series of natural communities that are replaced over time is known as succession and is of two types primary and secondary. The primary succession of water bodies such as lakes and ponds results in the conversion of these water bodies into the land community.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Which of the following is an example of one stage in ecological succession? A tree falls over in a forest.
