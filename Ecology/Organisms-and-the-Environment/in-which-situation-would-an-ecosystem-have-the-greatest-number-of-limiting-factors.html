<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-These are known as “pioneer species.” Primary succession begins when no plant life is present on the landscape, such as after a lava flow or glacial retreat. Over centuries, soil forms and deepens and successive communities of plants grow.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Primary succession occurs when new land is formed or bare rock is exposed, providing a habitat that can be colonized for the first time. For example, primary succession may take place following the eruption of volcanoes, such as those on the Big Island of Hawaii. As lava flows into the ocean, new rock is formed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-After an environmental disturbance such as a volcanic eruption or forest fire, communities are able to replace lost species through the process of succession. Primary succession occurs after a volcanic eruption or earthquake; it involves the breakdown of rocks by lichens to create new, nutrient-rich soils.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Lava from a volcanic eruption hardens into bare rock. Primary succession begins with soil formation. The first stage of succession involves pioneer species. In primary succession, pioneer plants are those that can grow without soil, such as lichens.
