<strong> A certain area of the Indian ocean is expected to dry up and become a desert over thousands of years. What will happen to the sustainability of this ocean? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Sustainability would increase because the number of species would increase 
</p>
<p>(B) Sustainability would remain the same 
</p>
<p>(C) ** Sustainability would decrease because the number of species would decrease 
</p>
<p>(D) Not enough information is given

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Keystone species have low functional redundancy. This means that if the species were to disappear from the ecosystem, no other species would be able to fill its ecological niche. The ecosystem would be forced to radically change, allowing new and possibly invasive species to populate the habitat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Greater biodiversity in ecosystems, species, and individuals leads to greater stability. For example, species with high genetic diversity and many populations that are adapted to a wide variety of conditions are more likely to be able to weather disturbances, disease, and climate change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-When might an increase in biodiversity lead to a decrease in the stability of an ecosystem? An increase in biodiversity usually leads to an increased stability, but in the case of an invasive species it would lead to a decreased stability.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Various factors can cause a change in an ecosystem. These changes include climate, habitat, invasion, pollution, invasive species, over-exploitation, and pollution.
