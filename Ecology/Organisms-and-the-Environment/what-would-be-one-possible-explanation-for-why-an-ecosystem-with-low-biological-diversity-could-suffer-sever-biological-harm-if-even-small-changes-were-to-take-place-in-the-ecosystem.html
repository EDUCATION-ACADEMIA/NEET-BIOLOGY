<strong> What would be one possible explanation for why an ecosystem with low biological diversity could suffer sever biological harm if even small changes were to take place in the ecosystem? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Abiotic factors such as light and water are very plentiful, affecting the interactions between different species. 
</p>
<p>(B) Each species is specialized to the limited conditions of the ecosystem and is therefore more able to adapt. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** Each of the species is more dependent on a low number of factors in the ecosystem. 
</p>
<p>(D) The ecosystem has abundant resources, and the organisms depend on each of them.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Declining biodiversity lowers an ecosystem’s productivity (the amount of food energy that is converted into the biomass) and lowers the quality of the ecosystem’s services (which often include maintaining the soil, purifying water that runs through it, and supplying food and shade, etc.).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Biodiversity, or the variety of all living things on our planet, has been declining at an alarming rate in recent years, mainly due to human activities, such as land use changes, pollution and climate change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Greater biodiversity in ecosystems, species, and individuals leads to greater stability. For example, species with high genetic diversity and many populations that are adapted to a wide variety of conditions are more likely to be able to weather disturbances, disease, and climate change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Biodiversity underpins the health of the planet and has a direct impact on all our lives. Put simply, reduced biodiversity means millions of people face a future where food supplies are more vulnerable to pests and disease, and where fresh water is in irregular or short supply. For humans that is worrying.
