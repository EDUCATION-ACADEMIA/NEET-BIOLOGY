<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Deforestation can directly lead to biodiversity loss when animal species that live in the trees no longer have their habitat, cannot relocate, and therefore become extinct. Deforestation can lead certain tree species to permanently disappear, which affects biodiversity of plant species in an environment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Deforestation can lead to a direct loss of wildlife habitat as well as a general degradation of their habitat. The removal of trees and other types of vegetation reduces available food, shelter, and breeding habitat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-It causes habitat destruction, increased risk of predation, reduced food availability, and much more. As a result, some animals lose their homes, others lose food sources – and finally, many lose their lives. In fact, deforestation is one of the main causes of extinction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-It is a serious environmental concern since it can result in the loss of biodiversity, damage to natural habitats, disturbances in the water cycle, and soil erosion.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The soil would become full of dangerous chemicals and pollutants that are usually filtered by trees. In addition, soil erosion is currently prevented by trees because they protect the land. However, soil would be unprotected, and vulnerable to reduction in soil quality and top soil nutrients.
