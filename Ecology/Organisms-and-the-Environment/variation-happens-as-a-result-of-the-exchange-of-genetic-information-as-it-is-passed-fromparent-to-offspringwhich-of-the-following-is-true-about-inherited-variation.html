<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Q. Variation happens as a result of the exchange of genetic information as it is passed fromparent to offspring. Which of the following is true about inherited variation? Variation can influence the resources that are available to an organism.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Genetic variation can be caused by mutation (which can create entirely new alleles in a population), random mating, random fertilization, and recombination between homologous chromosomes during meiosis (which reshuffles alleles within an organism’s offspring).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Mutations are changes in the genetic sequence, and they are a main cause of diversity among organisms. These changes occur at many different levels, and they can have widely differing consequences.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Only hereditary variants, which occur in egg or sperm cells, can be passed to future generations and potentially contribute to evolution. Some variants occur during a person’s lifetime in only some of the body’s cells and are not hereditary, so natural selection cannot play a role.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Heredity – the passing of traits from parents to offspring.
