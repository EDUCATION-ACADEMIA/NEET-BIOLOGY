<strong> Some traits of living organisms are inherited, while some behaviors must be learned. Which statement related to inherited traits or learned behaviors is not correct? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The ability of a figure skater to skin on ice is related to both inherited traits and learned behaviors. 
</p>
<p>(B) The ability of lions to use camouflage to hide in grassy fields is an inherited trait only. 
</p>
<p>(C) The number and type of legs a cricket has is an inherited trait only.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-An inherited trait is a characteristic that is passed from parents to their babies (offspring). A behavior is a way of acting. Inherited behaviors are called instincts. Learned behaviors are not inherited but learned from others.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Inherited traits, such as your eye color, are a part of your genetics and DNA from birth. They are passed down from parent to offspring, and therefore cannot be changed. Learned Behaviors are developed after birth and can be affected or changed. For example: Playing the violin is a learned behavior.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Both of their parents pass these traits to them, and they become a mix of their parents. Hair color, eye color, fur patterns are all examples of physical inherited traits. Behavioral inherited traits can include aspects of personality, learning style, vigilance, and desire to hunt.
