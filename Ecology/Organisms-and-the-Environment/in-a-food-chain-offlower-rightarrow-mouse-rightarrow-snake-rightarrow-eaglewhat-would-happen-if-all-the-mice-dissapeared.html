<p>(A) The flowers would increase because there are no mice to eat them, the snakes would increase because it has less to eat, and the eagles would decrease because there are too many snakes. 
</p>
<p>(B) The flowers would die because there is nothing to eat it. The snakes would decrease because they don’t have anything to eat. The eagles would decrease because the snakes are decreasing.

<p>(C) ** The flowers would increase because the mice are not eating them. The snakes would decrease because they have nothing to eat. The eagles would decrease because there are no snakes to eat.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Every organism follows this food chain by depending on another organism. If an organism is removed from the food chain, it spoils the flow of energy and nutrient in the ecosystem. It disrupts the balance of the food chain. As a result, the organisms which depend on others for food will die due to starvation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The population of frogs will increase as there would be no snakes to feed on them and the population of eagles will decrease as there would be no snakes for them to eat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-For example, if we remove plants from a food chain, no organism will get food as plants are the primary producers in the food chain. If herbivores are removed from a food chain then carnivores will starve and die and producers are also affected and may die due to competition for space and nutrients.
