<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Symbiosis. Symbiosis is a close relationship between organisms of different species in which at least one of the organisms benefits. The other organism may also benefit, it may be unaffected by the relationship, or it may be harmed by the relationship. Figure below shows an example of symbiosis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Interdependence is mutual dependence between things. If you study biology, you’ll discover that there is a great deal of interdependence between plants and animals. Inter-means “between, ” so interdependence is dependence between things. We often use interdependence to describe complex systems.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Interdependence. All organisms in an ecosystem depend upon each other. If the population of one organism rises or falls, then this can affect the rest of the ecosystem. If the foxes in the food chain above were killed, the population of rabbits would increase because they are no longer prey to the foxes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-All living things depend on their environment to supply them with what they need, including food, water, and shelter. Their environment consists of physical factors-such as soil, air, and temperature-and also of other organisms. An organism is an individual living thing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-These instances are the two types of mutualism: obligate and facultative. In obligate mutualism, the species involved are in close proximity and interdependent. This means that the absence of one meant the death of the other. They would not be able to survive without each other.
