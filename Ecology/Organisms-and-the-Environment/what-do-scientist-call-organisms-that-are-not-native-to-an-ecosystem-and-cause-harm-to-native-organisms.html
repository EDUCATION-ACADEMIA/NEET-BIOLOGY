<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Invasive alien species (IAS) are animals, plants or other organisms that are introduced into places outside their natural range, negatively impacting native biodiversity, ecosystem…
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An invasive species is an introduced, nonnative organism (disease, parasite, plant, or animal) that begins to spread or expand its range from the site of its original introduction and that has the potential to cause harm to the environment, the economy, or to human health.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An invasive species is an organism that is not indigenous, or native, to a particular area. Invasive species can cause great economic and environmental harm to the new area. Not all non-native species are invasive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-An invasive species is an organism that causes ecological or economic harm in a new environment where it is not native.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-invasive species, also called introduced species, alien species, or exotic species, any nonnative species that significantly modifies or disrupts the ecosystems it colonizes. Such species may arrive in new areas through natural migration, but they are often introduced by the activities of other species.
