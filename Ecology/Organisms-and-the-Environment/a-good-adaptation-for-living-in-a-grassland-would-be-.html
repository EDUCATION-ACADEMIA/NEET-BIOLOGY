<strong> A good adaptation for living in a grassland would be- 
</strong>
<p>(A) the ability to hibernate 
</p>
<p>(B) The ability of plants to grow very high to reach the sunlight

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Grassland plants have evolved so that as long as their roots survive, they can grow back after a fire very quickly. Trees and other plants not adapted to fire cannot grow back quickly, if they even survive. As a result, fire helps keep the grasslands from being overgrown by bushes and trees and turning into a forest.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Grasses are able to resist drought because they have thin-walled cells between the veins of their leaves. These cells keep the leaves expanded under normal conditions but roll up the leaves to slow evaporation during a drought. They grow rapidly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Adaptations make it easier for plants to survive in their specific habitat, and reproduce, passing those traits on to their offspring. All plants, no matter where they grow, are adapted to certain conditions, which can include temperature, available water, soil type, and interactions with animals and other organisms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Plants found in the grasslands are wild oats, foxtail, purple needle grass, ryegrass, and buffalo grass. Animals found in the grasslands are bison, gazelles, zebras, giraffes, rhinoceroses, wild horses, deer, and rabbits.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The savannah hypothesis (or savanna hypothesis) is a hypothesis that human bipedalism evolved as a direct result of human ancestorsâ€™ transition from an arboreal lifestyle to one on the savannas.
