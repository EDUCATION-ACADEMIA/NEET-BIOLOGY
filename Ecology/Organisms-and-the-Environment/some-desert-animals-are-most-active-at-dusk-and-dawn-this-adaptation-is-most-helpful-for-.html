<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Animal adaptations Some animals have developed salt glands, a physical adaptation that allows the secretion of salt without the loss of water. The absence of sweat glands, and the concentration of urine are other physical adaptations made by desert animals.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Animals survive in deserts by living underground or resting in burrows during the heat of the day. Some creatures get the moisture they need from their food, so they don’t need to drink much water, if any. Others live along the edges of deserts, where there are more plants and shelter.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Desert animals must keep cool, but to minimize water loss, they have to do it in ways that don’t involve much evaporation. Reptiles like the Texas horned lizard have tough, thick skin that doesn’t let water out. Desert mammals have fewer sweat glands than their counterparts in less extreme environments.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Getting back to our question, in the statement “even in very hot temperatures, desert animals like camels and Arabian oryx regulate body temperature by very rarely blank, ” the correct option to fill in the blank is given by answer choice (E), sweating.
