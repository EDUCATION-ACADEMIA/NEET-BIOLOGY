<strong> A North American grassland is usually more productive when it contains diverse plant communities. 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** The biodiversity allows some plant communities to survive when the ecosystem experiences slightly different weather patterns. 
</p>
<p>(B) The biodiversity allows all plant communities to survive when the ecosystem experiences an ice age. 
</p>
<p>(C) The biodiversity prevents some plant communities from surviving when the ecosystem experiences consistent weather patterns. 
</p>
<p>(D) The biodiversity prevents all plant communities from surviving when the ecosystem experiences a heat wave.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Greater biodiversity in ecosystems, species, and individuals leads to greater stability. For example, species with high genetic diversity and many populations that are adapted to a wide variety of conditions are more likely to be able to weather disturbances, disease, and climate change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Biodiversity refers to all the different kinds of living organisms within a given area. Biodiversity includes plants, animals, fungi, and other living things. Biodiversity can include everything from towering redwood trees to tiny, single-cell algae that are impossible to see without a microscope.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Coral reefs are believed by many to have the highest biodiversity of any ecosystem on the planet-even more than a tropical rainforest. Occupying less than one percent of the ocean floor, coral reefs are home to more than 25% of all marine life. Why is that important?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Natural selection can lead to speciation, where one species gives rise to a new and distinctly different species. It is one of the processes that drives evolution and helps to explain the diversity of life on Earth.
