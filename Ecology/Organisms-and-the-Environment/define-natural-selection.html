<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Natural selection is a mechanism of evolution. Organisms that are more adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and pass on the genes that aided their success. This process causes species to change and diverge over time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Natural selection is the process through which populations of living organisms adapt and change. Individuals in a population are naturally variable, meaning that they are all different in some ways. This variation means that some individuals have traits better suited to the environment than others.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Following Darwin, natural selection is sometimes defined as ecological selection, in which case sexual selection is considered a separate mechanism.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-An adaptation is any heritable trait that helps an organism, such as a plant or animal, survive and reproduce in its environment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Natural selection is a process where organisms with beneficial and advantageous traits survive better than others. As generations pass, the species will have many organisms that have that advantageous trait.
