<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Hence, we can conclude that ecosystem, biome and biosphere are the components of organisation that contain abiotic factors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Generally, the ecosystem is the lowest level of organization that is considered to include nonliving (abiotic) factors. So that would mean that ecosystems, biomes, and the biosphere include abiotic factors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-They are organized from smallest to largest; organism, population, community, ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Ecosystem: An ecosystem consists of all the biotic and abiotic factors that influence that community. Ecosystem ecologists often focus on flow of energy and recycling of nutrients.
