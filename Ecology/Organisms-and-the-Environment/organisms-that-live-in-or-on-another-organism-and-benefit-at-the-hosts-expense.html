<meta name="description" content="A parasite is an organism that lives on or in a host organism and gets its food from or at the expense of its host.

It lives in or on another organism, getting from it part or all of its food.Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species (the parasite) benefits while the other species (the host) is harmed. Many species of animals are parasites, at least during some stage of their life.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A parasite is an organism that lives on or in a host organism and gets its food from or at the expense of its host. There are three main classes of parasites that can cause disease in humans: protozoa, helminths, and ectoparasites. Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan. A microscope is necessary to view this parasite.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Explanation: Parasite: A parasite is an organism drawing nutrient from a living host. It lives in or on another organism, getting from it part or all of its food.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species (the parasite) benefits while the other species (the host) is harmed. Many species of animals are parasites, at least during some stage of their life. Most species are also hosts to one or more parasites.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In parasitism, one species (the parasite) lives with, on, or in a host species, at the expense of the host species. Unlike in predation, the host is not immediately killed by the parasite, though it may sicken and die over time. Examples of common parasites found in the ocean include nematodes, leeches, and barnacles.
