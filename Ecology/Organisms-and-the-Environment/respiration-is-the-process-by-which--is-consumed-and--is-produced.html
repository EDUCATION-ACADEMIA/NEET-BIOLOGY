<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The word respiration is commonly used to describe the process of breathing in oxygen and breathing out carbon dioxide. However, the term more formally refers to the chemical process organisms use to release the energy from food, which typically involves the consumption of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Photosynthesis converts carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and glucose. Glucose is used as food by the plant and oxygen is a by-product. Cellular respiration converts oxygen and glucose into water and carbon dioxide. Water and carbon dioxide are by-products and ATP is energy that is transformed from the process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-During cellular respiration, a glucose molecule is gradually broken down into carbon dioxide and water. Along the way, some ATP is produced directly in the reactions that transform glucose. Much more ATP, however, is produced later in a process called oxidative phosphorylation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-cellular respiration, the process by which organisms combine oxygen with foodstuff molecules, diverting the chemical energy in these substances into life-sustaining activities and discarding, as waste products, carbon dioxide and water.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The lungs and respiratory system allow us to breathe. They bring oxygen into our bodies (called inspiration, or inhalation) and send carbon dioxide out (called expiration, or exhalation). This exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide is called respiration.
