<strong> A rainforest ecosystem supports a variety of plant and animal species. This variety of life helps to maintain a balance within the ecosystem. What is one possible explanation related to a variety of species within a ecosystem to the overall balance of the ecosystem? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The variety of species helps support more abiotic factors. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** Each species meets a particular niche in the ecosystem. 
</p>
<p>(C) The variety of life allows for competition for resources among different species. 
</p>
<p>(D) The varied organisms increase the available space in the ecosystem.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Self-contained Ecosystems The fact that rainforests can exist despite infertile soil is due to a perfectly balanced, inbuilt recycling system. First, fallen leaves, dead animal and plant matter decompose on the topsoil.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Biodiversity refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth. ‘Biodiversity’ comes from two words: ‘biological’, which means relating to biology or living organisms, and ‘diversity’, meaning a range of different things or variety. Biodiversity is variation at the genetic, species, and ecosystem levels.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Biodiversity is all the different kinds of life you’ll find in one area-the variety of animals, plants, fungi, and even microorganisms like bacteria that make up our natural world. Each of these species and organisms work together in ecosystems, like an intricate web, to maintain balance and support life.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Biodiversity refers to the variety of living organisms within a given area.
