<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Many living things interact with other organisms in their environment. In fact, they may need other organisms in order to survive. This is known as interdependence, as depicted in the Figure below. For example, living things that cannot make their own food must eat other organisms for food.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An organism that cannot manufacture its own food and instead obtains its food and energy by taking in organic substances, usually plant or animal matter is a heterotroph. All animals, protozoans, fungi, and most bacteria are heterotrophs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Heterotrophs are the organisms which depend on other organisms for food. Mode of nutrition in these organisms is heterotrophic nutrition.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A habitat is a place where an organism makes its home.
