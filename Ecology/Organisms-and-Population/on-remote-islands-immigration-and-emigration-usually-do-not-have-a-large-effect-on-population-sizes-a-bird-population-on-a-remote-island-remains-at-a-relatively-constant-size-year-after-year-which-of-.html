<strong> On remote islands, immigration and emigration usually do not have a large effect on population sizes. A bird population on a remote island remains at a relatively constant size year after year. Which of the following most likely describes the birthrate and the death rate for this population? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Birthrate and death rate are both zero 
</p>
<p>(B) ** Birthrate and death rate are close to equal. 
</p>
<p>(C) Birthrate is significantly less than death rate. 
</p>
<p>(D) Birthrate is significantly greater than death rate.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A bird population on a remote island remains at a relatively constant size year after year. What would most likely describes the birthrate and the death rate for this population? Birthrate and death rate are close to equal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Immigration describes individuals moving into the population while emigration describes individuals exiting the population. If immigration rates are higher than emigration rates, the population increases, whereas if emigration rates are higher than immigration rates, the population size decreases.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Carrying capacity can be defined as a speciesâ€™ average population size in a particular habitat. The species population size is limited by environmental factors like adequate food, shelter, water, and mates. If these needs are not met, the population will decrease until the resource rebounds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Limiting factors determine the immigration capacity of a population. True 2. A limiting factor controls the growth of a population.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-If a population exceeds carrying capacity, the ecosystem may become unsuitable for the species to survive. If the population exceeds the carrying capacity for a long period of time, resources may be completely depleted. Populations may die off if all of the resources are exhausted.
