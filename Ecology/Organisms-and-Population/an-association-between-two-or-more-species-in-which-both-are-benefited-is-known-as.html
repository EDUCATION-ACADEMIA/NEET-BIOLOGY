<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A relationship between two species of organism where both the partners are benefited from each other is called as symbiosis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An interspecific association where both partners derive benefit from each other is called as commensalism. III. A direct food relation between two species of animals in which one kills and feeds on another is known as predation. IV. Neutralism is where neither population affects the other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A mutualistic relationship is when two organisms of different species benefit from each other in the relationship. Commensalism is an association between two organisms in which one benefits and the other derives neither benefit nor harm.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Symbiosis refers to a close and prolonged association between two organisms of different species. Mutualism refers to mutually beneficial interactions between members of the same or different species. Mutualistic interactions need not necessarily be symbiotic.
