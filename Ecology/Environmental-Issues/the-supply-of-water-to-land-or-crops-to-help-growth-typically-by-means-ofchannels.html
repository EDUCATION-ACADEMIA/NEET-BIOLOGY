<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The supply of water to the crops at different intervals of ti, e is called as irrigation. The time and frequency of irrigation vary from crop to crop, soil to soil and season to season. In the summer season, the frequency of watering is more due to the evaporation of water from the soil and leaves.
