<strong> What is true about the fresh water supply in Southwest Asia? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Desalination plants make fresh water cheaply 
</p>
<p>(B) Fresh water is plentiful and easily accessed 
</p>
<p>(C) Fresh water resources are evenly distributed in the region 
</p>
<p>(D) ** Many conflicts in the region are about access to fresh water

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Much of Southwest Asia is desert, so there is not a lot of water to use for drinking and irrigation. Water is not equally distributed; close to none of the countries in Southwest Asia have a good water source; this has been the cause for many clashes, including the 6 Day War, which was fought over water.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Israel has been involved in many conflicts over water rights to the Jordan River with Syria, Jordan, and Palestine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Oasis and underground river supplies also provide important sources of water for farming. Desalinization removes salt from sea water. Since areas like the Arabian Peninsula are surrounded by salt water, desalinization would greatly increase the amount of water suitable for irrigation in Southwest Asia.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The major rivers in SW Asia have become political issues because everyone needs to be able to use the water and there is only a limited amount. Dams built along the rivers have caused problems for people living further downstream because less water comes down the river to those people once the dam is built.
