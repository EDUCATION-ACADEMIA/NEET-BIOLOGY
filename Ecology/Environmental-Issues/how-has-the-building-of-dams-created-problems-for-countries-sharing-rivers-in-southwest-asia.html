<strong> How has the building of dams created problems for countries sharing rivers in Southwest Asia? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Dams are too expensive to build to be practical 
</p>
<p>(B) ** Dams limit the water available to countries further downstream 
</p>
<p>(C) Few countries have the technology needed to be able to build dams 
</p>
<p>(D) Countries in Southwest Asia are not allowed to build dams along shared rivers 
</p>
<p>
<div style ="text-align:center">
<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The major rivers in SW Asia have become political issues because everyone needs to be able to use the water and there is only a limited amount. Dams built along the rivers have caused problems for people living further downstream because less water comes down the river to those people once the dam is built.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The building of dams has created problems for countries sharing the same river because the dams block the natural flow of the river, forcing the water to stay in a certain territory and not giving the countries that follow downstream the water that they should be receiving.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Many countries in Southwest Asia are experiencing the increasing problem of water pollution. Farmers have begun using chemical fertilizers that run off from the fields and contaminate water supplies. Rapid growth of industry in cities and towns has caused garbage and sewage to build up in rivers and streams.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Why did the construction of the Atatürk Dam on the Euphrates River in Turkey cause conflict in Southwest Asia? The dam has caused flooding in other countries.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Others, like Iran, have areas with access to rivers and areas that are made up of deserts. Because water is in short supply in so many parts of Southwest Asia, irrigation has been necessary for those who want to farm and raise animals for market.
