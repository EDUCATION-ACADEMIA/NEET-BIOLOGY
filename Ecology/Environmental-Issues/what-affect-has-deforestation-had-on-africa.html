<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Deforestation directly impact on food security through the loss of biodiversity that are source of food to man and indirectly through its effect on soil degradation and alteration of the weather elements which in turn reduce agricultural productivity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The Food Chain and Deforestation Yet, deforestation is a leading cause of the need for more food by contributing to climate change and global warming, thereby making growing food harder, reducing crop yields per acre and ultimately driving farmers to convert even more of our global forests into cropland.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-As deforestation in Africa increases, less moisture is transpired into the atmosphere resulting in the formation of fewer rain clouds. Leading to less rain and subsequently this decline in rainfall could subject an area to drought.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-What are the key drivers for forest loss across Africa? Deforestation is directly being caused by activities such as illegal logging, agricultural development, mining and infrastructure projects – but there are reasons behind these activities which are often overlooked.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Climate change is intensifying food insecurity across sub-Saharan Africa, where Russia’s war in Ukraine and the pandemic are also adding to food shortages and high prices. Climate events, which destroy crops and disrupt food transport, are disproportionately common in the region.
