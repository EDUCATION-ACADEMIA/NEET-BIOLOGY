<strong> Why will Southeast Asia be especially impacted by climate change in the future? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** much of the population lives near coasts that will be flooded 
</p>
<p>(B) much of the population lives in the mountains that will receive less rainfall 
</p>
<p>(C) much of the region will turn into arid deserts 
</p>
<p>(D) much of the region is covered in rivers that will increase in salinity

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Southeast Asia and Pacific Islands are at risk from the impact of climate change in the next 20 years due to the region’s large and growing population, long coastlines, abundant low-lying areas, reliance on the agricultural sector, and dependence upon natural resources.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Countries across the region will face rising sea levels, heat waves, floods and droughts, and increasingly intense and unpredictable weather events.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Southeast Asia is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change with its extensive, heavily populated coastlines; large agricultural sectors; and large sections of the population living under $2 or even $1 a day.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-While the region’s greenhouse gas emissions have been low relative to those of advanced economies in per capita terms, that is starting to change, largely because of its increasing reliance on coal and other fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Climate change is driving these disasters. Historically in South Asia, the four months of the monsoon supply 80% of annual rainfall. Climate change has accelerated that water cycle, leading to extreme levels of rain in short periods, and droughts otherwise.
