<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Overall, cellphones have made communication more readily available; you can pick up your phone and instantly text or call someone almost anywhere in the world, provided they have cell reception available. Never before in history have humans been so connected to each other on a global scale.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The advent of the internet has made this world a global village, which is why the world feels a lot smaller than it is. The internet has made the world smaller by bringing people together. The internet allows people to call, chat and even send pictures to each other, bringing them closer despite being apart.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cell phones have also changed the way that people interact with each other. When we call someone, we are actually calling the person and not a place. This enables us to be more spontaneous when making plans as you rarely get a busy signal and unlike a land line telephone, someone is always home.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Increased communication speed is one of the benefits we get from mobile technology. Before the first phones and radios were operational, people could only communicate through the mail. If someone lived hundreds of miles away from you, it would have taken weeks or even longer to send and receive a single message.
