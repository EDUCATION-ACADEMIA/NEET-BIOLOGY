<strong> How has water in Southwest Asia become a regional issue(problem)? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** Water pollution and shortages have made water a scarce resource 
</p>
<p>(B) Abundance of water means countries get along better 
</p>
<p>(C) There is too much water in Southwest Asia causing flooding 
</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-As countries in Southwest Asia have worked to modernize their systems of agriculture, water pollution has been a growing problem. Increased demand for irrigation to expand farming has led to overuse of rivers and streams.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Water is scarce in the country, and what little water that is available is of poor quality because of salt water intrusion. The country has built a number of desalination plants that provide most of the countryâ€™s drinking water. Desalination is the process of taking salt out of seawater and using it for drinking water.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The 2 most valuable natural resources in Southwest Asia are oil and natural gas. Disputes over access to other natural resources, like oil, also cause conflict. The largest source of oil in the world is the region bordering the Persian Gulf.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Groundwater, especially shallow groundwater, in many sites in South Asia is contaminated with dangerously-high levels of arsenic (12). Long-term exposure to the high levels of arsenic in drinking-water reduce child survival (13), and lead to cognitive impairment (14), cardiovascular diseases (15), and cancer (16).
