<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The chemicals from the mining industry released into the air causes acid rain which in then tarnish the Great Lakes from the precipitation of the water cycle. Automobiles have also been known to emit smog and cause acid rain that will then be rained into the lakes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Acid rain has wiped out fishes, molluscs and frogs in thousands of Eastern Canada lakes . Acid rain has wiped out fishes, molluscs and frogs in thousands of Eastern Canada lakes (photo by Don E. McAllister). The pH scale measures the degree of acidity (artwork by Michael Lee).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Threats to the Great Lakes’ ecosystems, include invasive species, climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction. Climate change affects water temperatures, weather patterns, and lake levels. Pollutants from residential, agricultural, and industrial areas reduce water quality.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The acidification of surface waters can lead to declines in the fish population. Acidic water also affects aquatic plants and insects that are eaten by fish. As a result of these effects, the entire aquatic food chain can be “simplified, ” leaving a lake or stream less healthy, resilient, and productive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-High levels of acid in rain can damage or kill trees and pollute lakes enough to kill fish. Houses, buildings, and statues can also be damaged. Southern Canada (near the Great Lakes region) experiences the highest levels of acid rain. 50-75% of the pollution that causes acid rain actually comes from the US.
