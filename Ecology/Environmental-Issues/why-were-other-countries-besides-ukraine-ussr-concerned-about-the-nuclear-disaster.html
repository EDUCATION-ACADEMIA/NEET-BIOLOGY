<strong> Why were other countries besides Ukraine (USSR) concerned about the nuclear disaster? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Chernobyl had to shut down, so other plants shut down as well. 
</p>
<p>(B) Nuclear power became much more expensive. 
</p>
<p>(C) They did not have ways to help the people who evacuated. 
</p>
<p>(D) ** The radioactive material spread to other countries.
