<strong> Why is it difficult for Canada to effectively address the problem of acid rain? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Canada uses hydropower to produce most of the country’s electricity 
</p>
<p>(B) Commercial farming makes up the largest portion of Canada’s economy 
</p>
<p>(C) ** Much of Canada’s acid rain is caused by pollution from the United States 
</p>
<p>(D) Canada’s cities are surrounded by mountains that trap polluted air

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Many of the waters (streams, rivers, ponds, and lakes) and soils in Canada lack natural alkalinity, such as a lime base, and cannot neutralize acid naturally. Provinces that are part of the Canadian Precambrian Shield, such as Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, are most affected.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Acid rain has wiped out fishes, molluscs and frogs in thousands of Eastern Canada lakes . Acid rain has wiped out fishes, molluscs and frogs in thousands of Eastern Canada lakes (photo by Don E. McAllister). The pH scale measures the degree of acidity (artwork by Michael Lee).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Canada’s response. Canada created a federal-provincial team to devise a common solution ― the 1985 Eastern Canada Acid Rain Program. It established: An eastern Canada cap of 2.3 million tonnes of Sulphur Dioxide (SO2)in the seven easternmost provinces, to be met by 1994 and maintained until 2000.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Coal-burning factories, cars, &amp; trucks release chemicals that pollute the air. The pollutants mix with water molecules in clouds and turn the water acidic. High levels of acid in rain can damage or kill trees and pollute lakes enough to kill fish. Houses, buildings, and statues can also be damaged.
</p>

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Between 1972 and 1977, evidence linked acidification to the long-range transport of sulphur dioxide from sources in other countries-for Scandinavia, nations of continental Europe, and for Canada, the United States; within Canada there was also long-range transport between provinces.
