<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Acid rain has ruined nearly half of the Black Forest in southwestern Germany. It has damaged the soil and the trees growing in it. Many acres of diseased trees are at risk of dying. It is the main concern in the future.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-United States and Canada are the countries which are mostly affected by acid rain because of high number of factories, power plants and large number of automotive plants. Europe, Poland, Germany, Czech Republic, Sweden, Norway and Finland are affected because of British and European factories.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The acid rain caused massive devastation to trees, soils, rivers and lakes. By 1984 almost half of the trees in the nearby Black Forest showed signs of damage and images of blackened skeletal trees helped fuel the environmental movement.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Acid Rain has effected the black forest in Germany. The black forest got destroyed by acid rain because the soil of the trees in the forest is acidic soil and it is low, so it is near neutral. The soil is has a low acidic level. When acid rain drops it has a high level of acid and when acid rain drops.
