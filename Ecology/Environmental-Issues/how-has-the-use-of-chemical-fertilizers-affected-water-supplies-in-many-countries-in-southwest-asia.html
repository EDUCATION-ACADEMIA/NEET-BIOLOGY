<strong> How has the use of chemical fertilizers affected water supplies in many countries in Southwest Asia? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Use of chemical fertilizers means crops must be watered constantly 
</p>
<p>(B) Enormous amounts of water must be used to produce chemical fertilizers 
</p>
<p>(C) Chemical fertilizers have had very little effect on local water supplies in Southwest Asia 
</p>
<p>(D) ** Water supplies have contaminated by the chemicals through runoff from the fields

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Many farmers have begun to use chemical fertilizers, which have contaminated water supplies through runoff into these same rivers and streams. Constant planting and fertilizer use have led to building-up of salt levels in soils, eventually making it impossible to farm in those areas.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Many countries in Southwest Asia are experiencing the increasing problem of water pollution. Farmers have begun using chemical fertilizers that run off from the fields and contaminate water supplies. Chemicals also lead to salt build-up in the soil, which eventually makes farming in those areas impossible.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-How has the use of chemical fertilizers affected the water supplies in many countries in Southwest Asia? Water supplies have been contaminated by the chemicals through runoff from the fields.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Southwest Asiaâ€™s biggest pollution problems come from human sewage, agricultural runoff, and industrial waste. Rapid growth of industry in cities and towns has caused garbage and sewage to build up in rivers and streams. Towns without proper sewer systems dump untreated human waste directly into rivers.
