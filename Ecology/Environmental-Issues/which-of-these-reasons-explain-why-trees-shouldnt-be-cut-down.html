<meta name="description" content="The ecological balance will get disturbed, resulting in more frequent floods and droughts. The topmost fertile layer will be lost, resulting in reduced fertility and desertification with time.Trees are cut down for many reasons but the main reasons are to make space to build new houses and to clear land to grow grass for cows and sheep to eat, to produce dairy foods.

The tree has deep roots which give birth to tiny twigs and branches which help the tree attain its old stature. For a tree to be killed, the root has to be uprooted, and it has to be scorched and choked in sun and air.So, to take care of forests and towns, to keep people safe, and to get wood, people cut some trees down.

<strong> Which of these reasons explain why trees shouldn’t be cut down? 
</strong>
<p>(A) trees taste yum 
</p>
<p>(B) Deforestation provides jobs 
</p>
<p>(C) ** Many natural habitats lie within trees and other plants 
</p>
<p>(D) they’re just trees 
</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The ecological balance will get disturbed, resulting in more frequent floods and droughts. The topmost fertile layer will be lost, resulting in reduced fertility and desertification with time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Trees are cut down for many reasons but the main reasons are to make space to build new houses and to clear land to grow grass for cows and sheep to eat, to produce dairy foods. The trees which are cut down are sold and they are made into paper and furniture.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Trees absorb and store carbon dioxide. If forests are cleared, or even disturbed, they release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Forest loss and damage is the cause of around 10% of global warming. There’s simply no way we can fight the climate crisis if we don’t stop deforestation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Answer: It is not easy to kill a tree simply by hacking or chopping it. The tree has deep roots which give birth to tiny twigs and branches which help the tree attain its old stature. For a tree to be killed, the root has to be uprooted, and it has to be scorched and choked in sun and air.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-So, to take care of forests and towns, to keep people safe, and to get wood, people cut some trees down. We may not want to, but sometimes we need to. Some trees have defects or become damaged.
