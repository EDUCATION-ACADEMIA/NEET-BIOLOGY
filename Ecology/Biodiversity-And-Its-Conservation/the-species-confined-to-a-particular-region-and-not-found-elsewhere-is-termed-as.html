<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Endemic species are those species which are found in one particular place on the planet. They are not found anywhere else. Endemic species run a higher risk of extinction because of their geographic isolation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Endemism is a term used in biology to talk about the distribution of a taxon limited to a small geographic area and which can therefore be found naturally in this place. In consequence, endemic species are those that live in a limited area, such as a mountain range, lake or island, among others.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Species that are confined to some particular areas usually isolated by geographical barriers are known as Endemic Species.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Often an endemic species is confined to a certain area because they are highly adapted to the particular niche. They may eat only a certain type of plant that is found nowhere, or a plant is perfectly adapted to flourish in a very particular climate and soil type.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-There are two types of endemism-paleoendemism and neoendemism. Paleoendemism means that a species used to live in a large area but now lives only in a smaller area.
