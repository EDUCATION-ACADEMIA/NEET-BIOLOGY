<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-3. The Sikhote-Alin Mountains, and the Siberian tigers living on them, are separated from other mountain regions in which the tigers could live. The mountains are an example of a(n) a. mass extirpation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In ecology, an endemic species refers to a species that is native to where it is found. A species can be endemic to a particular small geographical area, such as a single island, or to a larger area, such as a continent. If it is found elsewhere, then, endemic is not the word to describe it.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Species, both plant and animal, are endemic if they are restricted, in one form or another, to a geographic area. In more common language, we would say “native, ” but endemic usually refers to a smaller area, such as an island.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-An ecosystem is considered stable if it is both resistant and resilient. At the international level, the United Nations has facilitated several treaties to promote biodiversity. Most scientists agree that cloning provides much help to prevent biodiversity loss.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In this video lesson we discuss about the 3 types of species that are present in the ecosystem namely, Normal, Endangered and Vulnerable species.
