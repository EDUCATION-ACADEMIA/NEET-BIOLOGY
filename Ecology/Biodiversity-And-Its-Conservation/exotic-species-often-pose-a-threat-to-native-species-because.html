<strong> Exotic species often pose a threat to native species because 
</strong>
<p>(A) they are more genetically diverse than native species. 
</p>
<p>(B) they can establish themselves quickly and become invasive. 
</p>
<p>(C) native species are vulnerable to the same parasites as exotic species. 
</p>
<p>(D) ** they often crossbreed with native species.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Invasive species that are closely related to rare native species have the potential to hybridize with the native species. Harmful effects of hybridization have led to a decline and even extinction of native species.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-When a new and aggressive species is introduced into an ecosystem, it may not have any natural predators or controls. It can breed and spread quickly, taking over an area. Native wildlife may not have evolved defenses against the invader, or they may not be able to compete with a species that has no predators.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Exotic species introduced to new environments often reset the ecological conditions in that new habitat, threatening the species that exist there; this is the reason that they are also termed invasive species.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-To be invasive, a species must adapt to the new area easily. It must reproduce quickly. It must harm property, the economy, or the native plants and animals of the region. Many invasive species are introduced into a new region accidentally.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The difference between native, exotic, and invasive species is that a native species is one that originally comes from a particular area or ecosystem. Exotic and invasive species are organisms that are introduced to new areas to which they are not native.
