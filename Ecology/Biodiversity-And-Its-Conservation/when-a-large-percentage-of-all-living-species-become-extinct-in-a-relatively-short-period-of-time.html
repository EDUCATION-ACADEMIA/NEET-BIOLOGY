<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-At five other times in the past, rates of extinction have soared. These are called mass extinctions, when huge numbers of species disappear in a relatively short period of time. Paleontologists know about these extinctions from remains of organisms with durable skeletons that fossilized.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Mass extinctions-when at least half of all species die out in a relatively short time-have occurred only a handful of times over the course of our planet’s history. The largest mass extinction event happened around 250 million years ago, when perhaps 95 percent of all species went extinct.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Based on evidence in the fossil record, scientists have identified major extinction events at the end of these geologic periods: Cretaceous Period-66 million years ago. Triassic Period-201 million years ago. Permian Period-252 million years ago.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Although the best-known cause of a mass extinction is the asteroid impact that killed off the non-avian dinosaurs, in fact, volcanic activity seems to have wreaked much more havoc on Earth’s biota. Volcanic activity is implicated in at least four mass extinctions, while an asteroid is a suspect in just one.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-To explain what caused this mass extinction, scientists have focused on events that would have altered our planet’s climate in dramatic, powerful ways. The leading theory is that a huge asteroid or comet slammed into Earth 65 million years ago, blocking sunlight, changing the climate and setting off global wildfires.
