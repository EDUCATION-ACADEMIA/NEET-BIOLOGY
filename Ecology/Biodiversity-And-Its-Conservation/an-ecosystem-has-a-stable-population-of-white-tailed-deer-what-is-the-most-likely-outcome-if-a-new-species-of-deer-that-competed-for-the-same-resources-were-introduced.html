<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-An ecosystem has a stable population of white-tailed deer. What is the most likely outcome if a new species of deer that competed for the same resources were introduced? The white-tailed deer population would increase.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-What will most likely occur if the population of the world continues to increase at predicted rates? There will be more rapid depletion of natural resources.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If the nitrogen-fixing bacteria were destroyed by a virus, the most likely result would be a decrease in nitrogen compounds available to organisms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-If all the nitrogen-fixing bacteria disappeared, plants and animals wouldnâ€™t receive the nitrogen compounds they need to carry out certain functions. The absence of this important source of nitrogen would probably cause disease and death among plants, which would lead to declines in animal populations.
