<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Destruction of Habitat – It is currently the biggest cause of current extinctions. Deforestation has killed off more species than we can count.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), plant and animal species may be listed as either endangered or threatened. “Endangered” means a species is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. “Threatened” means a species is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The Living Planet Index (LPI) data tells us how species are faring, by measuring trends in monitored populations of vertebrate species. It is not a census of all wildlife, but reports the average percentage change in size of these populations monitored throughout the world.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In ecology, an endemic species refers to a species that is native to where it is found. A species can be endemic to a particular small geographical area, such as a single island, or to a larger area, such as a continent. If it is found elsewhere, then, endemic is not the word to describe it.
