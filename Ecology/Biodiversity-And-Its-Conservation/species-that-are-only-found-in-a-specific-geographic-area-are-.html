<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Endemism is a term used in biology to talk about the distribution of a taxon limited to a small geographic area and which can therefore be found naturally in this place. In consequence, endemic species are those that live in a limited area, such as a mountain range, lake or island, among others.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Endemic species are those plants and animals that exist only in one geographical region. Species can be endemic to large or small areas of the world. Some may be endemic to the particular continent; some are endemic to a part of a continent, and others to a single island.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Endemic species are plant and animal species that are found in a particular geographical region and nowhere else in the world. Some species are endemic to a continent while others can be endemic to an island. E.g., Lemurs of Madagascar and Tortoises of Galapagos.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Species found only in a particular area is known as Endemic species.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Endemic species are especially likely to develop on geographically and biologically isolated areas such as islands and remote island groups, including Hawaii, the Galápagos Islands and Socotra, because of the potential for isolation and therefore evolution through allopatric speciation.
