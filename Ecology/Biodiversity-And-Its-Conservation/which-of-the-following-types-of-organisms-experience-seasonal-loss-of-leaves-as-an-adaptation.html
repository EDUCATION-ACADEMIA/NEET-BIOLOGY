<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The defining characteristic of deciduous trees is their recurring total loss of leaves, which may be seasonal, but can also be facilitated by climate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The answer is C. Deciduous is a description of a plant or shrub that has the capability or characteristic of falling off leaves or shed off due to maturation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Root Structure Plants that grow in the desert have adapted the structure of their roots to be able to thrive with very little rainfall. Some plants have adapted to take advantage of any rainfall that occurs while others have adapted to look for water very deep in the ground.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Biomes are characterized by their climates as well as typical plant and animal life.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Climographs show monthly average temperatures and precipitation totals on a single graph. Rather than showing measured data for specific time periods-like the graphs you generated in Part A-climographs show long term averages for all 12 months of the year.
