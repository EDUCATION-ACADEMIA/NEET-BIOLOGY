<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Eutrophication is the process by which a body of water becomes enriched in dissolved nutrients (as phosphates), stimulating the growth of aquatic plant life usually resulting in the depletion of dissolved oxygen.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An overabundance of nutrients-primarily nitrogen and phosphorus-in water starts a process called eutrophication. Algae feed on the nutrients, growing, spreading, and turning the water green. Algae blooms can smell bad, block sunlight, and even release toxins in some cases.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Nutrient pollution is one of America’s most widespread, costly and challenging environmental problems, and is caused by excess nitrogen and phosphorus in the air and water.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Harmful algal blooms, dead zones, and fish kills are the results of a process called eutrophication-which occurs when the environment becomes enriched with nutrients, increasing the amount of plant and algae growth to estuaries and coastal waters.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Nutrient pollution is the process where too many nutrients, mainly nitrogen and phosphorus, are added to bodies of water and can act like fertilizer, causing excessive growth of algae.
