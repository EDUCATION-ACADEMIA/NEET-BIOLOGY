<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Local extinction, also known as extirpation, refers to a species (or other taxon) of plant or animal that ceases to exist in a chosen geographic area of study, though it still exists elsewhere. Local extinctions are contrasted with global extinctions. Local extinctions mark a change in the ecology of an area.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Extirpation (also known as ‘local extinction’) describes the situation in which a species or population no longer exists within a certain geographical location.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-EXTINCT: A species that no longer exists. EXTIRPATED: A species that no longer exists in the wild in Canada, but occurring elsewhere. ENDANGERED: A species facing imminent extirpation or extinction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Extinction and Extirpation by Human Beings Human beings cause habitat loss by converting natural landscapes to urban or agricultural landscapes and through pollution, mining, draining, and deforestation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Extinction is the death of all members of a species of plants, animals, or other organisms.
