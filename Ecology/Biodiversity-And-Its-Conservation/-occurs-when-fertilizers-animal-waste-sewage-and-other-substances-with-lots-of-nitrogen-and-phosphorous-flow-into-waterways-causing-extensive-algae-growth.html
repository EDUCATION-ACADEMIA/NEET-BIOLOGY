<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Nutrient pollution, a form of water pollution, is a primary cause of eutrophication of surface waters, in which excess nutrients, usually nitrogen or phosphorus, stimulate algal and aquatic plant growth. A common visible effect of eutrophication is algal blooms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Nutrient pollution is the process where too many nutrients, mainly nitrogen and phosphorus, are added to bodies of water and can act like fertilizer, causing excessive growth of algae. Nutrients can run off of land in urban areas where lawn and garden fertilizers are used.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An overabundance of nutrients-primarily nitrogen and phosphorus-in water starts a process called eutrophication. Algae feed on the nutrients, growing, spreading, and turning the water green. Algae blooms can smell bad, block sunlight, and even release toxins in some cases.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Harmful algal blooms, dead zones, and fish kills are the results of a process called eutrophication-which occurs when the environment becomes enriched with nutrients, increasing the amount of plant and algae growth to estuaries and coastal waters.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Too much nitrogen and phosphorus in the water causes algae to grow faster than ecosystems can handle. Significant increases in algae harm water quality, food resources and habitats, and decrease the oxygen that fish and other aquatic life need to survive.
