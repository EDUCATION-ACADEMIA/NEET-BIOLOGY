<meta name="description" content="Populations with more genetic diversity are less able to cope with environmental change. Species are evenly distributed among taxonomic groups. In recent decades, extinction rates have been significantly lower than normal.Current rates of extinction are about 1000 times the background rate of extinction.

For example, species with high genetic diversity and many populations that are adapted to a wide variety of conditions are more likely to be able to weather disturbances, disease, and climate change.The current extinction rate is approximately 100 extinctions per million species per year, or 1, 000 times higher than natural background rates.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Populations with more genetic diversity are less able to cope with environmental change. Species are evenly distributed among taxonomic groups. In recent decades, extinction rates have been significantly lower than normal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Current rates of extinction are about 1000 times the background rate of extinction. These are higher than previously estimated and likely still underestimated.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Greater biodiversity in ecosystems, species, and individuals leads to greater stability. For example, species with high genetic diversity and many populations that are adapted to a wide variety of conditions are more likely to be able to weather disturbances, disease, and climate change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The current extinction rate is approximately 100 extinctions per million species per year, or 1, 000 times higher than natural background rates. They also predict that future rates may be as much as 10, 000 times higher.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Nature loss can also weaken the biodiversity that collectively dilutes and defends against some disease threats. For instance, scientists say that more diverse bird populations can help buffer humans against the effects of West Nile virus. Deterioration of nature hurts our ability to heal, too.
