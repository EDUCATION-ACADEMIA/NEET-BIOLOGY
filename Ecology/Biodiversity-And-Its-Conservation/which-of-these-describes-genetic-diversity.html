<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Genetic variation is a measure of the genetic differences that exist within a population. The genetic variation of an entire species is often called genetic diversity. Genetic variations are the differences in DNA segments or genes between individuals and each variation of a gene is called an allele.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Genetic Diversity is the diversity of genetic characteristics (expressed or recessive) within a species (i.e. between individuals and populations of the same species).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Genetic Diversity refers to the range of different inherited traits within a species. In a species with high genetic diversity, there would be many individuals with a wide variety of different traits.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Which of the following best describes the genetic variation of a population? Genetic variation refers to the fact that different individuals of a population have different alleles of genes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The diversity of alleles and genotypes within a population is called genetic variance. When scientists are involved in the breeding of a species, such as with animals in zoos and nature preserves, they try to increase a populationâ€™s genetic variance to preserve as much of the phenotypic diversity as they can.
