<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Environmental resistance factors are things that limit the growth of a population. They include biotic factors-like predators, disease, competition, and lack of food-as well as abiotic factors-like fire, flood, and drought. The biotic potential of a population is how well a species is able to survive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A population can shrink either because of biotic or abiotic limits. An increase in predators, the emergence of a new disease, or the loss of habitat are just three possible problems that will decrease a population. A population may also shrink if it grows too large for the resources required to support it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Population growth rate is affected by birth rates, death rates, immigration, and emigration. If a population is given unlimited amounts of food, moisture, and oxygen, and other environmental factors, it will show exponential growth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Anything that can limit the size of a population, including living and nonliving features of an ecosystem, is called a limiting factor. An example of a factor that could limit the size of a population might be a hunter or a drought.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In the natural world, limiting factors like the availability of food, water, shelter and space can change animal and plant populations. Other limiting factors, like competition for resources, predation and disease can also impact populations.
