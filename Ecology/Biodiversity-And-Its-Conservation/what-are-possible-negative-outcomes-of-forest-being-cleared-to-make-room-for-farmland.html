<strong> What are possible negative outcomes of forest being cleared to make room for farmland? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** Fewer trees for animal habitats 
</p>
<p>(B) ** Fertilizers create run-off into a nearby stream, polluting it. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** Less room for animals to hunt and find shelter 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The loss of trees and other vegetation can cause climate change, desertification, soil erosion, fewer crops, flooding, increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and a host of problems for Indigenous people.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Consequences of deforestation Deforestation disturbs the balance in nature. If cutting of trees continues, rainfall and the fertility of the soil will decrease. Apart from this there will be increased chances of natural calamities such as floods and droughts. Plants need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.
