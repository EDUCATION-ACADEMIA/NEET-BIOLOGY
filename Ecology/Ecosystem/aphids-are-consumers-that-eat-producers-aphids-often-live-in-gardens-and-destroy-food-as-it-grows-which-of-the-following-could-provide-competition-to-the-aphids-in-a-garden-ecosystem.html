<strong> Aphids are consumers that eat producers. Aphids often live in gardens and destroy food as it grows. Which of the following could provide competition to the aphids in a garden ecosystem? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** The introduction of a species to the environment that eats vegetables 
</p>
<p>(B) The removal of spiders from the environment through pesticide use 
</p>
<p>(C) The creation of a new breed of tomato plant with larger fruit 
</p>
<p>(D) The addition of a new species to the ecosystem that preys on aphids

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-What Do Organisms Compete For? Organisms compete for the resources they need to survive-air, water, food, and space. In areas where these are sufficient, organisms live in comfortable co-existence, and in areas where resources are abundant, the ecosystem boasts high species richness (diversity).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-You may think of the ladybug as a simple predator preying on the aphids; however, by eating the aphids, the ladybug is also protecting the plant. In return, the plant indirectly provides the ladybug with a steady supply of food. This is an example of mutualism, a relationship in which both organisms benefit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If we were in the warm waters of the Pacific or Indian Oceans, we’d likely spot an excellent example of mutualism: the relationship between clownfish and sea anemones. In a mutualistic relationship, both species benefit. Sea anemones live attached to the surface of coral reefs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A mutualistic relationship is when two organisms of different species “work together, ” each benefiting from the relationship. One example of a mutualistic relationship is that of the oxpecker (a kind of bird) and the rhinoceros or zebra.
