<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Ecological Niche: An organism’s role or occupation within a community.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Biodiversity is the variety of all living things; the different plants, animals and micro organisms, the genetic information they contain and the ecosystems they form.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A niche refers to the role of a species in its ecosystem. It includes all the ways that the species interacts with the biotic and abiotic factors of the environment. Two important aspects of a species’ niche are the food it eats and how the food is obtained.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Coral reefs are believed by many to have the highest biodiversity of any ecosystem on the planet-even more than a tropical rainforest. Occupying less than one percent of the ocean floor, coral reefs are home to more than 25% of all marine life.
