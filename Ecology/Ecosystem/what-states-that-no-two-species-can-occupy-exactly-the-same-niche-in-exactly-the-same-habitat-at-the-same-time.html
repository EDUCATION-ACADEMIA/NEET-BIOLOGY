<title>What states that no two species can occupy exactly the same niche in exactly the same habitat at the same time
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Gauses principle of competitive exclusion states that two species competing for the same limiting resource cannot coexist in the same niche indefinitely.The competitive exclusion principle states that no two species can occupy exactly the same niche in exactly the same habitat at exactly the same time. If two species attempt to occupy the same niche, one species will be better at competing for limited resources and will eventually exclude the other species.No two species can have the exact same niche, otherwise they would be in direct competition for resources with one another. If this occurs, then one species will outcompete the other. If the losing species then does not adapt, it would lead to its extinction.Answer and Explanation: The principle that states that two different species cannot occupy the same niche in a given habitat is called Competetive exclusion. More precisely, it is called as Gauses Law of competitive exclusion. This law was proposed by G.F Gause in 1934.The Russian ecologist G. F. Gause is best known for developing the competitive exclusion principle (Chapter 8, Gause, 1934). This principle asserts that no two species can exploit the environment in exactly the same way and coexist – one of the species will be excluded.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Gause’s principle of competitive exclusion states that two species competing for the same limiting resource cannot coexist in the same niche indefinitely.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The competitive exclusion principle states that no two species can occupy exactly the same niche in exactly the same habitat at exactly the same time. If two species attempt to occupy the same niche, one species will be better at competing for limited resources and will eventually exclude the other species.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-No two species can have the exact same niche, otherwise they would be in direct competition for resources with one another. If this occurs, then one species will outcompete the other. If the losing species then does not adapt, it would lead to its extinction.

</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The principle that states that two different species cannot occupy the same niche in a given habitat is called Competetive exclusion. More precisely, it is called as Gause’s Law of competitive exclusion. This law was proposed by G.F Gause in 1934.
