<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Ecosystems contain biotic or living, parts, as well as abiotic factors, or nonliving parts. Biotic factors include plants, animals, and other organisms. Abiotic factors include rocks, temperature, and humidity. Every factor in an ecosystem depends on every other factor, either directly or indirectly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The environment includes abiotic (nonliving) and biotic (living) factors. An ecosystem consists of all the biotic and abiotic factors in an area and their interactions. A niche refers to the role of a species in its ecosystem. A habitat is the physical environment in which a species lives and to which it is adapted.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Biotic and abiotic factors are what make up ecosystems. Biotic factors are living things within an ecosystem; such as plants, animals, and bacteria, while abiotic are non-living components; such as water, soil and atmosphere. The way these components interact is critical in an ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A biotic factor is a living organism that shapes its environment. In a freshwater ecosystem, examples might include aquatic plants, fish, amphibians, and algae. Biotic and abiotic factors work together to create a unique ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Abiotic and biotic factors combine to create a system or, more precisely, an ecosystem, meaning a community of living and nonliving things considered as a unit. In this case, abiotic factors span as far as the pH of the soil and water, types of nutrients available and even the length of the day.
