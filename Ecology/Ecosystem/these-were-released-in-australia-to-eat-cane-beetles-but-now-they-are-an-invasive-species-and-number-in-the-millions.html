<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Cane toads became pests after being introduced into Australia to control destructive beetles in Queensland’s sugarcane crops. Cane toads are capable of poisoning predators that try to eat them and they continue to spread across Australia.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Invasive species In 1935, at the request of sugarcane plantation owners, the government released about 2, 400 cane toads into north Queensland to help control cane beetles, which eat the roots of sugarcane.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The introduction of cane toads (Bufo marinus) to Australia in the 1930s is one of the foremost examples of an exotic animal release gone wrong. Originally imported from Hawaii and released in Queensland as a biological control for beetle pests of sugar cane, the cane toad is now a well-established pest itself.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The cane toad (Bufo marinus) is a type of anuran that is native to South and Central America, but was introduced to Australia in 1935 in attempt to control the population of beetles that was eating sugarcane crops.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Cane toads (Bufo marinus) were a complete failure at killing Australia’s sugar cane-ravaging beetles. Instead of controlling the pests, the toads have become pests themselves.
