<strong> A native species and a non-native species are competing for resources within the same ecosystem. The non-native species is more likely to survive than the native species in which of the following situations? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Both the native species and the non-native species thrive on the same food source. 
</p>
<p>(B) The native species is immune to certain pathogens in the ecosystem.

<p>(C) Predators prey on both native and non-native species.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A native species and a non-native species are competing for resources within the same ecosystem. The non-native species is more likely to survive than the native species in which of the following situations? Both the native species and the non-native species thrive on the same food source.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Invasive species are capable of causing extinctions of native plants and animals, reducing biodiversity, competing with native organisms for limited resources, and altering habitats. This can result in huge economic impacts and fundamental disruptions of coastal and Great Lakes ecosystems.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-D Species diversity is greater in the ecosystem undergoing secondary succession because the soil already contains seeds and spores of various species. As ecosystems move through the stages of succession, the populations of organisms in them change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-When a new and aggressive species is introduced into an ecosystem, it may not have any natural predators or controls. It can breed and spread quickly, taking over an area. Native wildlife may not have evolved defenses against the invader, or they may not be able to compete with a species that has no predators.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-To be invasive, a species must adapt to the new area easily. It must reproduce quickly. It must harm property, the economy, or the native plants and animals of the region. Many invasive species are introduced into a new region accidentally.
