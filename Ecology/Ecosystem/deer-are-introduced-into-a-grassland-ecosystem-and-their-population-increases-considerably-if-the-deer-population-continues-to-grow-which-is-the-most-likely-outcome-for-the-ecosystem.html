<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-How will a thriving grassland ecosystem MOST likely be affected by a drought? Animals will be forced to migrate. How does an ecosystem benefit when leaves fall from a tree and decompose on the soil? Nutrients are released into the soil.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Abiotic factors are the non-living parts of the environment that have a major influence on living organisms. They can help determine things like how tall trees grow, where animals and plants are found, and why birds migrate. The most important abiotic factors include water, sunlight, oxygen, soil and temperature.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Ecological succession is the process that describes how the structure of a biological community (that is, an interacting group of various species in a desert, forest, grassland, marine environment, and so on) changes over time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-1: Pioneer species are the first to colonize: During primary succession in lava on Maui, Hawaii, succulent plants are the pioneer species. After weathering breaks down the lava into soil, the plants are able to take root. These plants will help to further change the soil by adding nutrients to it.
