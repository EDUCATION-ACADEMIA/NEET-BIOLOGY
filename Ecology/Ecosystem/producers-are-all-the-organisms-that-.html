<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Producers, also known as autotrophs, make their own food. They make up the first level of every food chain. Autotrophs are usually plants or one-celled organisms. Nearly all autotrophs use a process called photosynthesis to create “food” (a nutrient called glucose) from sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Primary producers use energy from the sun to produce their own food in the form of glucose, and then primary producers are eaten by primary consumers who are in turn eaten by secondary consumers, and so on, so that energy flows from one trophic level, or level of the food chain, to the next.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Producers are organisms that produce their own energy from sunlight. Producers turn sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into food in the form of a sugar. Plants are producers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Ecosystems where there is not enough sunlight for photosynthesis to occur are powered by chemoautotrophs-primary producers that do not use energy from the sun. Instead, they break apart inorganic chemical compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide, and use the energy released to make organic molecules.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Producers: Producers are organisms that get their energy directly from the Sun. Their cells are able to turn sunlight into food through a process called photosynthesis. In photosynthesis, producers combine carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to produce oxygen and sugar (their food).
