<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A food web is a feeding relationship among the various organisms in an ecosystem that forms a network of complex interactions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A model of the complex feeding interactions among organisms in a community from producers to decomposers is called: food web.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-“An ecosystem is a complex set of relationships among the living resources, habitats and residents of an area. It includes plants, trees, animals, fish, birds, micro-organisms, water, soil and people….
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Within the discipline of ecology, researchers work at four general levels, which sometimes overlap. These levels are organism, population, community, and ecosystem (Figure 1).
</p>
<p>
