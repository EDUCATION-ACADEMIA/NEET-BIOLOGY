<title>What is a native species?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="In biogeography, a native species is indigenous to a given region or ecosystem if its presence in that region is the result of only local natural evolution (though often popularised as with no human intervention) during history. The term is equivalent to the concept of indigenous or autochthonous species.A native species is found in a certain ecosystem due to natural processes such as natural distribution. The koala, for example, is native to Australia. No human intervention brought a native species to the area or influenced its spread to that area. Native species are also sometimes called indigenous species.Plants or animals that are native to a particular region live or grow there naturally and were not brought there.When a species is indigenous, its found in a particular location or surrounding areas. An endemic species, however, is a native species found only in a picky area, large or small. Often an endemic species is confined to a certain area because they are highly adapted to the particular niche.Endemic refers to a species that is uniquely found in one part of the world, and that part only! These types of animals are most commonly found in more isolated parts of the globe, like islands, but they can be found in other places too.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In biogeography, a native species is indigenous to a given region or ecosystem if its presence in that region is the result of only local natural evolution (though often popularised as “with no human intervention") during history. The term is equivalent to the concept of indigenous or autochthonous species.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A native species is found in a certain ecosystem due to natural processes such as natural distribution. The koala, for example, is native to Australia. No human intervention brought a native species to the area or influenced its spread to that area. Native species are also sometimes called indigenous species.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Plants or animals that are native to a particular region live or grow there naturally and were not brought there.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-When a species is indigenous, it’s found in a particular location or surrounding areas. An endemic species, however, is a native species found only in a picky area, large or small. Often an endemic species is confined to a certain area because they are highly adapted to the particular niche.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-“Endemic” refers to a species that is uniquely found in one part of the world, and that part only! These types of animals are most commonly found in more isolated parts of the globe, like islands, but they can be found in other places too.
