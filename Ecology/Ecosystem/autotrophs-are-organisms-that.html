<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Autotrophs are the producers in the food chain, meaning they create their own nutrients and energy. Kelp, like most autotrophs, creates energy through a process called photosynthesis. An autotroph is an organism that can produce its own food using light, water, carbon dioxide, or other chemicals.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Autotrophic organisms take inorganic substances into their bodies and transform them into organic nourishment. Autotrophs are essential to all life because they are the primary producers at the base of all food chains.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Chemoautotrophs. Chemoautotrophs are those that make organic compounds as food by chemosynthesis. They use chemical energy to produce carbohydrates instead of light energy as photoautotrophs do. They utilize inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, sulfur, ammonium, and ferrous iron as reducing agents.
</p>

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Autotrophic organismsâ€™ processes to produce organic material from inorganic substances are chemosynthesis. Chemosynthesis is the process where inorganic substances like carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, or hydrogen gas are converted to carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Autotrophs ("self-feeders") are also known producers because they produce organic compounds from inorganic materials. They make their own food. Autotrophs require energy to do so, and most autotrophs use light energy in the process of photosynthesis.
