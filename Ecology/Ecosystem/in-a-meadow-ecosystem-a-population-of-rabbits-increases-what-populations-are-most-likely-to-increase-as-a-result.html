<strong> In a meadow ecosystem, a population of rabbits increases. What populations are most likely to increase as a result? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** foxes, hawks, and other predators of the rabbits 
</p>
<p>(B) leafy plants that rabbits eat 
</p>
<p>(C) rabbits that live elsewhere

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Explanation: There would be more food for the rabbits and slugs, so their populations would increase. However, there would be less food for the frogs and voles, so their populations would decrease. This means less food for the foxes and hawks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The foxes depend on the rabbits as a food source. When there are many rabbits present, the fox population grows. However, when there is a larger fox population, more rabbits are being hunted, so the rabbit population decreases.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The foxes, hawks, and owls would have less to eat without the rabbits. As a result, fewer foxes, hawks, and owls would live in the ecosystem because there would be less food for them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A warm spring can produce more acorns and tree nuts, which in turn becomes food for squirrels and rabbits to feed off of. The rabbit population is also increasing due to changes to the population of their predators. Coyotes are steering away red foxes, and they prey on rabbits and squirrels.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-2. What happens to the bunny population when the wolf population increases? The bunny population slows its rate of increase and then decreases as the wolf population increases.
