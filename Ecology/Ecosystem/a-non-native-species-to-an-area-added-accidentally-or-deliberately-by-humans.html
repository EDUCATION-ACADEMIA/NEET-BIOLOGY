<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Invasive alien species are animals, plants or other organisms that are introduced by humans, either intentionally or accidentally, into places outside of their natural range, negatively impacting native biodiversity, ecosystem services or human economy and well-being.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Invasive species are animals or plants from another region of the world that donâ€™t belong in their new environment. They can be introduced to an area by ship ballast water, accidental release, and most often, by people.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Encyclopedic Entry Vocabulary. An invasive species is an organism that is not indigenous, or native, to a particular area. Invasive species can cause great economic and environmental harm to the new area.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-It also is possible for a species to be invasive in one ecosystem but not in another. Invasive species are often successful in their new ecosystems because they can reproduce and grow rapidly, or because their new environment lacks any natural predators or pests.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The Gypsy Moth, Nutria, Zebra Mussel, Hydrilla, Sea Lamprey and Kudzu are examples of non-natives that have caused massive economic and ecological losses in new locations because the natural controls of their native ecosystems were not there.
