<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In an ecosystem, you would most expect to find interspecific competition between populations of two species that occupy the same niche. two wasp species that mimic each other’s appearance. males of a species during the breeding season. males and females of a species in which both sexes occupy the same niche.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Competition between two species for the same resources is called interspecific competition, which is when two or more species in a community are competing for resources.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Interspecific competition results in resource partitioning (how organisms live together w/out going extinct). The more the niches of two species overlap (meaning less resource partitioning), the more the size of the populations will be limited.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-a) The competitive exclusion principle, also called Gause’s Principle, states that when two species compete for exactly the same resources (thus, they occupy the same niche), one is likely to be more successful. As a result, one species “outcompetes” the other species, and eventually the second species is eliminated.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot occupy the exact same niche in a habitat. In other words, different species cannot coexist in a community if they are competing for all the same resources.
