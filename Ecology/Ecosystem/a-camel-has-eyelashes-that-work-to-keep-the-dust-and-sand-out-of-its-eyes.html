<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Camels are well adapted to life in hot, dry climates. Cushioned feet stop them from sinking into the desert sand, long eyelashes keep the sand out of their eyes, and their nostrils close shut during a dust storm.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Camels have adapted in many ways to living in a harsh desert environment. For instance, they have three eyelids and two sets of eyelashes to keep blowing sand and dust out of their eyes. They can also close their nostrils if necessary to keep the dust out.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Camels are adapted to live in extreme environments, both hot and cold. Unlike a lot of other mammals, most of a camel’s fat is stored in its humps, which allows for better thermoregulation. It makes it easier for them to release heat from their bodies in hot weather. Camels rarely sweat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Camels have long eyelashes which protect the eyes from the sand during a sandstorm in the desert. The hump of the camel acts as a storage for fats that lets the animal survive without food for months.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The adaptations that help camels to survive in the desert are: Long legs: To beat the heat of the sand. Flat feet: To avoid sinking in the sand while walking. Hump: To store fat which is utilized by the camels for energy when food is scarce.
