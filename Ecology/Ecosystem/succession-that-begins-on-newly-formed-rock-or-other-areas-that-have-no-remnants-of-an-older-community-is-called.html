<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-What is primary succession ? Primary succession is ecological succession that begins in essentially lifeless areas, such as regions in which there is no soil or where the soil is incapable of sustaining life (because of recent lava flows, newly formed sand dunes, or rocks left from a retreating glacier).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Primary Succession Retreating glaciers can have the same effect, leaving only exposed bare rock behind them. Succession that begins in an area with no remnants of an older community is called primary succession.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Primary succession happens when a new patch of land is created or exposed for the first time. This can happen, for example, when lava cools and creates new rocks, or when a glacier retreats and exposes rocks without any soil. During primary succession, organisms must start from scratch.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Primary succession occurs in an environment without previous life, or a barren habitat. Secondary succession occurs in an area that had previously been inhabited but experienced a disturbance, such as a lava flow.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Primary succession occurs where no ecosystem has existed before. It is a very slow process because it begins on bare rock.
