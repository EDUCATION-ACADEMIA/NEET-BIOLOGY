</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Speciation is how a new kind of plant or animal species is created. Speciation occurs when a group within a species separates from other members of its species and develops its own unique characteristics.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Natural selection explains how genetic traits of a species may change over time. This may lead to speciation, the formation of a distinct new species.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-It is an evolutionary process that leads to the formation of a new and distinct species that is reproductively isolated from another species. Speciation is also called ‘cladogenesis’, which means arising from a splitting event where the parent is split into two distinct species.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A species is a group of organisms with similar characteristics and can interbreed to give fertile offspring. Speciation is an evolutionary process of the formation of new and distinct species. The species evolve by genetic modification.
