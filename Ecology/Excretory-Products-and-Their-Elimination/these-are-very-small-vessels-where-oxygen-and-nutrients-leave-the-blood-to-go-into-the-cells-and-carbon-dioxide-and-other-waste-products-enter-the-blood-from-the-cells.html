<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Capillaries are small, thin blood vessels that connect the arteries and the veins. Their thin walls allow oxygen, nutrients, carbon dioxide and waste products to pass to and from the tissue cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Arteries carry blood away from the heart and veins carry blood back to the heart. The circulatory system carries oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to cells, and removes waste products, like carbon dioxide. These roadways travel in one direction only, to keep things going where they should.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The oxygen then moves into the blood by passing first through the very thin walls of the air sacs and then into the capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels in a network within the lungs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Capillaries: These tiny blood vessels have thin walls. Oxygen and nutrients from the blood can move through the walls and get into organs and tissues. The capillaries also take waste products away from your tissues. Capillaries are where oxygen and nutrients are exchanged for carbon dioxide and waste.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Arteries are blood vessels that transport blood away from the heart to the rest of the body. Veins are the blood vessels that carry the blood back toward the heart.
