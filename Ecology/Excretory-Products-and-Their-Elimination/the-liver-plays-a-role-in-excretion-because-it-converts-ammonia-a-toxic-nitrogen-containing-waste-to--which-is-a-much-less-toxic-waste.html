<meta name="description" content="With the help of specific catalysts in the liver cells carbon dioxide reacts chemically with the ammonia molecule, NH3. The less toxic nitrogenous compound urea is produced together with water. This series of reactions is called the ornithine cycle.It helps in the excretion of vitamins, drugs, steroid hormones, and waste material through bile. The liver converts the amino acids present in the blood into ammonia and pyruvic acid. Pyruvic acid gets oxidized to release energy, and ammonia gets converted into urea.The liver manufactures blood serum proteins, including albumin and several clotting factors, and supplies them to the blood. The liver also metabolizes nitrogenous waste products and detoxifies poisonous substances, preparing them for elimination in the urine or feces.Ammonia, urea and uric acids are toxic, nitrogenous waste products produced by break down of protein and nucleic acids. These waste products have to be excreted. Ammonia is highly toxic and has a high solubility in water. Urea is less soluble and less toxic than ammonia.The liver produces several chemicals (enzymes) that change ammonia into a form called urea, which the body can remove in the urine. If this process is disturbed, ammonia levels begin to rise. Several inherited conditions can cause problems with this waste-removal process.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-With the help of specific catalysts in the liver cells carbon dioxide reacts chemically with the ammonia molecule, NH3. The less toxic nitrogenous compound urea is produced together with water. This series of reactions is called the ornithine cycle.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-It helps in the excretion of vitamins, drugs, steroid hormones, and waste material through bile. The liver converts the amino acids present in the blood into ammonia and pyruvic acid. Pyruvic acid gets oxidized to release energy, and ammonia gets converted into urea.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The liver manufactures blood serum proteins, including albumin and several clotting factors, and supplies them to the blood. The liver also metabolizes nitrogenous waste products and detoxifies poisonous substances, preparing them for elimination in the urine or feces.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Ammonia, urea and uric acids are toxic, nitrogenous waste products produced by break down of protein and nucleic acids. These waste products have to be excreted. Ammonia is highly toxic and has a high solubility in water. Urea is less soluble and less toxic than ammonia.
