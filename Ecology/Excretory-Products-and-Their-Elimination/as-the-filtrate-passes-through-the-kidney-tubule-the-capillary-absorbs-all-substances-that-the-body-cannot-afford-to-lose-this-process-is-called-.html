<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Tubular reabsorption is the process that moves solutes and water out of the filtrate and back into your bloodstream.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Selective reabsorption is the process whereby certain molecules (e.g. ions, glucose and amino acids), after being filtered out of the capillaries along with nitrogenous waste products (i.e. urea) and water in the glomerulus, are reabsorbed from the filtrate as they pass through the nephron.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-When the filtrate exits the glomerulus, it flows into a duct in the nephron called the renal tubule. As it moves, the needed substances and some water are reabsorbed through the tube wall into adjacent capillaries. This reabsorption of vital nutrients from the filtrate is the second step in urine creation.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption are quantitatively very large relative to the amount excreted! Glomerular filtration is non-selective whereas tubular reabsorption is highly selective.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The reabsorption of filtered molecules, i.e. H+ Na+, K+, ions from the glomerular filtrate in the tubules to the blood is called selective reabsorption. About 85% of the 180L of filtrate formed per day is reabsorbed by this process.
