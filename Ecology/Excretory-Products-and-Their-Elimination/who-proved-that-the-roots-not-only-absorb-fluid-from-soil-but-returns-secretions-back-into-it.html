<title>Who proved that the roots not only absorb fluid from soil but returns secretions back into it?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Answer. Answer: Brugmans said that roots not only absorb water, fluid from soil but return a portion of their peculiar secretions back into it. Brugmans studied plant excretion and found that some plants exude an acid fluid from their spongioles.Brugaman a botanist proved from his experiments that the roots not only absorb fluid from the soil but returns a portion of their peculiar secretions back into it.

The diffusion of water molecules through a semi-permeable membrane is called osmosis. Root hair absorbs water from soil through osmosis.Transportation: The water in the plant body transports substances in a solution form from one part to another.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Answer. Answer: Brugmans said that roots not only absorb water, fluid from soil but return a portion of their peculiar secretions back into it. Brugmans studied plant excretion and found that some plants exude an acid fluid from their spongioles.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-’Brugaman’ a botanist proved from his experiments that the roots not only absorb fluid from the soil but returns a portion of their peculiar secretions back into it. It is for this reason when plants especially potted plants are uprooted and removed, they leave their characteristic smell in the soil.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Water from the soil is absorbed by the roots through a process known as osmosis. The cell membrane of the root hair cells acts as a semi-permeable membrane. The cell sap inside the vacuole is a strong solution with low water concentration.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Explanation: The plants absorb water from the soil with the help of root hair through osmosis. The diffusion of water molecules through a semi-permeable membrane is called osmosis. Root hair absorbs water from soil through osmosis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Transportation: The water in the plant body transports substances in a solution form from one part to another. Food production: Water is utilised for food production along with carbon dioxide from the air in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll to produce glucose and oxygen by the process of photosynthesis.
