<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Each of your kidneys is made up of about a million filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron includes a filter, called the glomerulus, and a tubule. The nephrons work through a two-step process: the glomerulus filters your blood, and the tubule returns needed substances to your blood and removes wastes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The artery then branches so blood can get to the nephrons (pronounced: NEH-fronz)-1 million tiny filtering units in each kidney that remove the harmful substances from the blood. Each of the nephrons contain a filter called the glomerulus (pronounced: gluh-MER-yuh-lus).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Glomerular filtration is the first step in making urine. It is the process that your kidneys use to filter excess fluid and waste products out of the blood into the urine collecting tubules of the kidney, so they may be eliminated from your body.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-urine: A liquid excrement consisting of water, salts, and urea, which is made in the kidneys then released through the urethra. glomerulus: A small, intertwined group of capillaries within nephrons of the kidney that filter the blood to make urine.
