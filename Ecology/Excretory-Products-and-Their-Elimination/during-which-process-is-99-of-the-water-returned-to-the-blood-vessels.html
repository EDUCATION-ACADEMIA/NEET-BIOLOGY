<title>During which process is 99% of the water returned to the blood vessels?

<meta name="description" content="Answer and Explanation: The kidneys return water and small solutes to the blood by the process of b. reabsorption.Step 1 in urine formation, Filtration-Fluid pressure forces water and dissolved substances out of the blood into Bowmans capsule. Filtration averages 125 ml/min for your two kidneys. This amounts to about 180 Liters per day. Since we urinate an average of 1500 ml per day, more than 99% must be returned to the blood.Tubular reabsorption is the process that moves solutes and water out of the filtrate and back into your bloodstream.Reabsorption is the movement of water and solutes from the tubule back into the plasma. Reabsorption of water and specific solutes occurs to varying degrees over the entire length of the renal tubule. Bulk reabsorption, which is not under hormonal control, occurs largely in the proximal tubule.On average, 180L of water is filtered by the kidneys daily. However, only 1.5-2L actually ends up being excreted as urine. This means almost 99% of the water filtered is either reabsorbed into the circulation or enters the interstitium.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The kidneys return water and small solutes to the blood by the process of b. reabsorption.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Step 1 in urine formation, Filtration-Fluid pressure forces water and dissolved substances out of the blood into Bowmanâ€™s capsule. Filtration averages 125 ml/min for your two kidneys. This amounts to about 180 Liters per day. Since we urinate an average of 1500 ml per day, more than 99% must be returned to the blood.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Tubular reabsorption is the process that moves solutes and water out of the filtrate and back into your bloodstream.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Reabsorption is the movement of water and solutes from the tubule back into the plasma. Reabsorption of water and specific solutes occurs to varying degrees over the entire length of the renal tubule. Bulk reabsorption, which is not under hormonal control, occurs largely in the proximal tubule.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-On average, 180L of water is filtered by the kidneys daily. However, only 1.5-2L actually ends up being excreted as urine. This means almost 99% of the water filtered is either reabsorbed into the circulation or enters the interstitium.
