<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Oxygen moves from the alveoli to the blood through the capillaries (tiny blood vessels) lining the alveolar walls. This process is called diffusion. In the bloodstream, oxygen gets picked up by the hemoglobin in red blood cells. This oxygen-rich blood then goes to the heart, which pumps it to the body.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The circulatory system, which is made up of the heart and blood vessels, supports the respiratory system by bringing blood to and from the lungs. The circulatory system helps deliver nutrients and oxygen from the lungs to tissues and organs throughout the body.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The Respiratory System Oxygen gets into the blood through tiny blood vessels around the alveoli. Red blood cells pick up the oxygen and deliver it to the body’s cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-At each cell in your body, oxygen is exchanged for a waste gas called carbon dioxide. Your bloodstream then carries this waste gas back to the lungs where it is removed from the bloodstream and then exhaled. Your lungs and respiratory system automatically perform this vital process, called gas exchange.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The circulatory and respiratory systems work together to circulate blood and oxygen throughout the body. Air moves in and out of the lungs through the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. Blood moves in and out of the lungs through the pulmonary arteries and veins that connect to the heart.
