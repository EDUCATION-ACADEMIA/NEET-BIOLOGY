<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Stratified columnar epithelium: This type of epithelium is not as common and is seen in the mucous membrane (conjunctiva) lining your eyelids, where it’s both protective and mucus-secreting. Pseudostratified columnar epithelium: This type of epithelium lines your upper respiratory tract and usually has a lot of cilia.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A stratified epithelium consists of multiple stacked layers of cells. This epithelium protects against physical and chemical damage. The stratified epithelium is named by the shape of the most apical layer of cells, closest to the free space.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Epithelium (plural: epithelia) is a continuous layer of cells packed tightly together that covers anatomical structures or lines cavities. These cells can be either a single layer or a stack of multiple sheets.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Epithelial cells come in different shapes depending on where in the body they’re found. These shapes are called squamous, cuboidal, columnar, and ciliated columnar. Squamous epithelial cells are flat and are usually found lining surfaces that require a smooth flow of fluid, such as your blood vessels.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-"Columnar” signifies that the cells at the free surface are considerably taller than wide. By convention, cells are called columnar if their height is at least twice their width, and cuboidal if not so tall. A columnar epithelium is often associated with secretion or absorption.
