They typically occur together in vascular bundles in all plant organs, traversing roots, stems, and leaves. Xylem is responsible for the transport of water and dissolved ions from the roots upwards through the plant.Xylem is the complex tissue of plants, responsible for transporting water and other nutrients to the plants. Phloem is living tissue, responsible for transporting food and other organic materials.Xylem and phloem are called vascular or conducting tissues because both xylem and phloem tissues transport materials in plants, they are together called vascular tissues.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Answer: Xylem and phloem are the conducting tissues of the vascular strands. Their main role is in the transportation of food, minerals, and water. Xylem is the tissue which is responsible for the transport of water in plants while the phloem is responsible for the transfer of food and nutrients in the plant.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Xylem carries water and minerals from the roots to the leaves. Whereas, phloem carries the food prepared by the leaves to different parts of the plant.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-4.1. Vascular tissue is comprised of the xylem and the phloem, the main transport systems of plants. They typically occur together in vascular bundles in all plant organs, traversing roots, stems, and leaves. Xylem is responsible for the transport of water and dissolved ions from the roots upwards through the plant.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Xylem is the complex tissue of plants, responsible for transporting water and other nutrients to the plants. Phloem is living tissue, responsible for transporting food and other organic materials.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Xylem and phloem are called vascular or conducting tissues because both xylem and phloem tissues transport materials in plants, they are together called vascular tissues.
