<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Barrier: Epithelial tissue commonly functions as a covering or lining for organs and other tissues (e.g., skin, mucous membranes, pleural cavity, etc.). Epithelial cells serve as selective barriers between the environment and the internal structures of the body.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Epithelial tissues are widespread throughout the body. They form the covering of all body surfaces, line body cavities and hollow organs, and are the major tissue in glands. They perform a variety of functions that include protection, secretion, absorption, excretion, filtration, diffusion, and sensory reception.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Epithelia constitute fundamental tissue barriers of the body; they separate tissue compartments, enable exchange of essential nutrients and waste products, and protect the body from the external environment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Epithelial tissues provide the bodyâ€™s first line of protection from physical, chemical, and biological damage. The cells of an epithelium act as gatekeepers of the body, controlling permeability by allowing selective transfer of materials across its surface. All substances that enter the body must cross an epithelium.
