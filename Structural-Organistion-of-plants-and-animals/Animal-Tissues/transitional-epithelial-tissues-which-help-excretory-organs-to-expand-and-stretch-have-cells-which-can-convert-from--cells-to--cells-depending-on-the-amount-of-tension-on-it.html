<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Transitional epithelium: A transitional epithelium (also known as urothelium) is made up of several layers of cells that become flattened when stretched. It lines most of your urinary tract and allows your bladder to expand.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Transitional epithelium is a stratified tissue made of multiple cell layers, where the cells constituting the tissue can change shape depending on the distention in the organ. When the organ is filled with fluid, cells on the topmost layer of this epithelium can stretch and appear flattened.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-When the urinary bladder fills with urine, the bladder wall stretches to accommodate the increased volume. In the distended bladder, the urothelium reorganizes into two or three layers without any structural damage. Due to this transitional ability of the urothelium, it is also known as the transitional epithelium.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The bladder is lined with transitional epithelium, which has multiple layers of epithelial cells that are able to contract and expand as organs become distended. The organs of the urinary system are all lined with transitional epithelium for this reason.
