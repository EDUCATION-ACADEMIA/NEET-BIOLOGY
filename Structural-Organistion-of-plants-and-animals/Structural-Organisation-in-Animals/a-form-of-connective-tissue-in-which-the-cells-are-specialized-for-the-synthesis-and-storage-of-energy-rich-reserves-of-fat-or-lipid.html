<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Adipose tissue, also known as fat tissue or fatty tissue, is a connective tissue that is mainly composed of fat cells called adipocytes. Adipocytes are energy storing cells that contain large globules of fat known as lipid droplets surrounded by a structural network of fibers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Adipose tissue is a type of loose connective tissue located mainly beneath the skin. The cells of this tissue are specialised to store fats.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-What is adipose tissue? Adipose tissue, otherwise known as body fat, is a connective tissue that extends throughout your body. Itâ€™s found under your skin (subcutaneous fat), between your internal organs (visceral fat) and even in the inner cavities of bones (bone marrow adipose tissue).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Adipose tissue is the energy-storing connective tissue. It consists of adipocytes, cells filled with lipids (fats). This tissue has a small amount of ECM made of only a few collagen fibers that keep the cells together.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Adipose (fat) cells are specialized for the storage of energy in the form of triglycerides, but research in the last few decades has shown that fat cells also play a critical role in sensing and responding to changes in systemic energy balance.
