<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The human body maintains a temperature of around 98.6 degrees at all times. Enzymes are involved in almost every chemical reaction in the body. Which of the following describes the connection between these two statements? Enzymes function best at a specific temperature.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-As temperature increases, enzyme reactions increase. But if the temperature gets too high, the enzyme stops working. That’s why a high fever can disrupt bodily functions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The correct answer is (c) because they allow reactions to occur at body temperature. Enzymes catalyze chemical reactions, which means that they make chemical reactions occur rapidly at body temperature.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-There is a certain temperature at which an enzyme’s catalytic activity is at its greatest (see graph). This optimal temperature is usually around human body temperature (37.5 oC) for the enzymes in human cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Like all other catalysts, enzymes are characterized by two fundamental properties. First, they increase the rate of chemical reactions without themselves being consumed or permanently altered by the reaction. Second, they increase reaction rates without altering the chemical equilibrium between reactants and products.
