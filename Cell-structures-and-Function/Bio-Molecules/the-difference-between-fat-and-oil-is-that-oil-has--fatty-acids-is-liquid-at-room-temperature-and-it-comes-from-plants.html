<meta name="description" content="The main difference between fats and oils is that fats are composed of high amounts of saturated fatty acids which will take a solid form at room temperature whereas oils are composed of mainly unsaturated fatty acids which will take a liquid form at room temperature.One difference between fats and oils is that at room temperature fats are solid whereas oils are liquid. Fats and oils are both made of one part called glycerol attached to three other parts called fatty acids. Glycerol is a thick liquid with many industrial uses.The major difference between fats and oils are as follows: Fats are solid at room temperature whereas oils are found in the liquid state at room temperature. Fats increase cholesterol levels, but oils control it. Fats are either saturated or trans whereas oils are unsaturated.Fatty acids are the building blocks of the fat in our bodies and in the food we eat. During digestion, the body breaks down fats into fatty acids, which can then be absorbed into the blood. Fatty acid molecules are usually joined together in groups of three, forming a molecule called a triglyceride.The building blocks of unsaturated fats have bends or kinks that dont allow the blocks to be tightly stacked and thus, appear more fluid and are liquid at room temperature.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The main difference between fats and oils is that fats are composed of high amounts of saturated fatty acids which will take a solid form at room temperature whereas oils are composed of mainly unsaturated fatty acids which will take a liquid form at room temperature.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-One difference between fats and oils is that at room temperature fats are solid whereas oils are liquid. Fats and oils are both made of one part called glycerol attached to three other parts called fatty acids. Glycerol is a thick liquid with many industrial uses.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The major difference between fats and oils are as follows: Fats are solid at room temperature whereas oils are found in the liquid state at room temperature. Fats increase cholesterol levels, but oils control it. Fats are either saturated or trans whereas oils are unsaturated.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Fatty acids are the building blocks of the fat in our bodies and in the food we eat. During digestion, the body breaks down fats into fatty acids, which can then be absorbed into the blood. Fatty acid molecules are usually joined together in groups of three, forming a molecule called a triglyceride.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The building blocks of unsaturated fats have bends or kinks that donâ€™t allow the blocks to be tightly stacked and thus, appear more fluid and are liquid at room temperature.
