Found in both unicellular and multicellular organisms.Cells are the smallest, structural, and functional unit of an organism. Tissues are the distinct types of material consisting of specialized cells and also types of their products. Cells are microscopic. Tissues are macroscopic.Just as cells join together to form tissues, different tissues join together to form organs. An organ is a structure made up of two or more tissues that work together to carry out a specific job. Ex: Your heart, is an organ made up of muscle tissue, blood tissue, and nerve tissue.Tissues are evenly distributed throughout the body and perform similar functions. Organs are made up of tissues and are organised and perform specific functions in plants and animals. These are made up of same type of cells. These are made up of same type of tissues.Your body is made of cells and when groups of cells do the same kind of work, they are called tissues. You have four main types of tissues: Connective, Epithelial, Muscle, and Nervous tissue. Connective tissue joins bones and cushions organs. Epithelial tissue covers the outside of the body.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Cells are the smallest structural and functional units of an organism, which are characteristically microscopic. Tissues are clusters of cells, specialized cells. Found in both unicellular and multicellular organisms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Cells are the smallest, structural, and functional unit of an organism. Tissues are the distinct types of material consisting of specialized cells and also types of their products. Cells are microscopic. Tissues are macroscopic.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Just as cells join together to form tissues, different tissues join together to form organs. An organ is a structure made up of two or more tissues that work together to carry out a specific job. Ex: Your heart, is an organ made up of muscle tissue, blood tissue, and nerve tissue.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Tissues are evenly distributed throughout the body and perform similar functions. Organs are made up of tissues and are organised and perform specific functions in plants and animals. These are made up of same type of cells. These are made up of same type of tissues.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Your body is made of cells and when groups of cells do the same kind of work, they are called tissues. You have four main types of tissues: Connective, Epithelial, Muscle, and Nervous tissue. Connective tissue joins bones and cushions organs. Epithelial tissue covers the outside of the body.
