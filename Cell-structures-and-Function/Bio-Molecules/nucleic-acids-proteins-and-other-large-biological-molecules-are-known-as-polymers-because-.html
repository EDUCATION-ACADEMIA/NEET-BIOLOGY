<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and proteins are often found as long polymers in nature. Because of their polymeric nature and their large (sometimes huge!) size, they are classified as macromolecules, big (macro-) molecules made through the joining of smaller subunits.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Nucleic acids, proteins, and other large biological molecules are known as polymers because. They contain many small, repeating subunits bonded together. What is the main difference between organic and inorganic molecules? Organic molecules contain carbon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-These are known as macromolecules. Most macromolecules are polymers, which are long chains of subunits called monomers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Biomacromolecules are large biological polymers, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and carbohydrates, that are made up of monomers linked together.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Both nucleic acids and proteins are made of the repeating monomer units, which is why they are considered polymers. Nucleic acids are made of nucleotides, which consist of a phosphate, a 5-carbon sugar, and a nitrogenous base. Proteins are composed of amino acids.
