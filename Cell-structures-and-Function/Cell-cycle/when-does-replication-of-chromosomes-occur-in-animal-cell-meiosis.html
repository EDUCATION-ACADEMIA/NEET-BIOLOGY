<title>When does replication of chromosomes occur in animal cell meiosis?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Before meiosis begins, during S phase of the cell cycle, the DNA of each chromosome is replicated so that it consists of two identical sister chromatids, which remain held together through sister chromatid cohesion. This S-phase can be referred to as premeiotic S-phase or meiotic S-phase.Before meiosis begins, the DNA in each chromosome is replicated. The two identical copies that result from this DNA replication are referred to as sister chromatids, and are joined to each other by a region of the chromosome called the centromere (as shown in figure 1).DNA replication occurs in both mitosis and meiosis. In meiosis, the cell undergoes two divisions, i.e. meiosis I and II. Meiosis I is reduction division and meiosis II is similar to mitosis but DNA replicates only once during meiosis, i.e. before meiosis I in S phase.Before entering meiosis I, a cell must first go through interphase. This is the same interphase that occurs before mitosis. The cell grows, copies its chromosomes and prepares for division during the G 1start subscript, 1, end subscript phase, S phase, and G 2start subscript, 2, end subscript phase of interphase.Meiosis, divided into meiosis I and meiosis II, is a process in which a diploid cell divides itself into four haploid cells. Note that meiosis II immediately follows meiosis I; DNA replication does not occur after meiosis I.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Before meiosis begins, during S phase of the cell cycle, the DNA of each chromosome is replicated so that it consists of two identical sister chromatids, which remain held together through sister chromatid cohesion. This S-phase can be referred to as “premeiotic S-phase” or “meiotic S-phase".
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Before meiosis begins, the DNA in each chromosome is replicated. The two identical copies that result from this DNA replication are referred to as ‘sister chromatids’, and are joined to each other by a region of the chromosome called the centromere (as shown in figure 1).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-DNA replication occurs in both mitosis and meiosis. In meiosis, the cell undergoes two divisions, i.e. meiosis I and II. Meiosis I is reduction division and meiosis II is similar to mitosis but DNA replicates only once during meiosis, i.e. before meiosis I in S phase.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Before entering meiosis I, a cell must first go through interphase. This is the same interphase that occurs before mitosis. The cell grows, copies its chromosomes and prepares for division during the G 1start subscript, 1, end subscript phase, S phase, and G 2start subscript, 2, end subscript phase of interphase.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Meiosis, divided into meiosis I and meiosis II, is a process in which a diploid cell divides itself into four haploid cells. Note that meiosis II immediately follows meiosis I; DNA replication does not occur after meiosis I.
