<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-If a cell is exposed to a chemical that inhibits the production of spindle fibers as the cell is preparing for mitosis, what would MOST likely happen? The cell would continue with mitotic division.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: If the spindle fibers failed to form during mitosis, then the chromosomes would also fail to segregate naturally. The spindle fibers are involved in the movement and positioning of chromosomes during cell division.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-What is a result of preventing spindle fibers from forming? The cell cycle skips Go phase and repeats G1 phase. Mitotic division is skipped, and the cell cycle proceeds to cytokinesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-This is called the spindle checkpoint and helps ensure that the sister chromatids will split evenly between the two daughter cells when they separate in the next step. If a chromosome is not properly aligned or attached, the cell will halt division until the problem is fixed. Anaphase.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Since colchicines inhibits growth of spindle fibres and the major role of spindle fibre is to pull the chromosomes to the poles during anaphase. So, colchicines treated cells will enter in cell cycle but will be arrested at metaphase. Q. Colchicine is a chemical that stops chromatids from separating during mitosis.
