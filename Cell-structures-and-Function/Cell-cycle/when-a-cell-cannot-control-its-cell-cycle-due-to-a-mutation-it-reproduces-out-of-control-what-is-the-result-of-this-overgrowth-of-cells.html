<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Disruption of normal regulation of the cell cycle can lead to diseases such as cancer. When the cell cycle proceeds without control, cells can divide without order and accumulate genetic errors that can lead to a cancerous tumor .
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Cancer is unchecked cell growth. Mutations in genes can cause cancer by accelerating cell division rates or inhibiting normal controls on the system, such as cell cycle arrest or programmed cell death.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cancer is the result of unchecked cell division caused by a breakdown of the mechanisms that regulate the cell cycle. The loss of control begins with a change in the DNA sequence of a gene that codes for one of the regulatory molecules. Faulty instructions lead to a protein that does not function as it should.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Cancers, however, occur due to an alteration of a normal biological process-cell division. Cells that progress through the cell cycle unchecked may eventually form malignant tumors, where masses of cells grow and divide uncontrollably, then develop the ability to spread and migrate throughout the body.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The loss of cell cycle control begins with a DNA sequence change of a gene that codes for one of the regulatory molecules, known as a mutation. Faulty instructions lead to a protein that does not function normally. Each successive cell division will give rise to daughter cells with even more accumulated damage.
