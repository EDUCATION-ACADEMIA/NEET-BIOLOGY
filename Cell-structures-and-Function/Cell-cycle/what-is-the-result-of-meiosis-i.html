<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-This separation means that each of the daughter cells that results from meiosis I will have half the number of chromosomes of the original parent cell after interphase. Also, the sister chromatids in each chromosome still remain connected. As a result, each chromosome maintains its X-shaped structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-During meiosis I, the random orientation of the maternal and paternal chromosomes can lead to variation. The exchange of genetic information between homologous chromosomes also induces variation. The random orientation of sister chromatids in meiosis II also generates genetic variation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Each daughter cell has half the number of chromosomes as compared to their parents (one copy of each chromosome). The resulting cells from meiosis are not genetically identical because of the recombination of genes that occurred during prophase 1.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-However, Meiosis I begins with one diploid parent cell and ends with two haploid daughter cells, halving the number of chromosomes in each cell. Meiosis II starts with two haploid parent cells and ends with four haploid daughter cells, maintaining the number of chromosomes in each cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-At the conclusion of meiosis, there are four haploid daughter cells that go on to develop into either sperm or egg cells.
