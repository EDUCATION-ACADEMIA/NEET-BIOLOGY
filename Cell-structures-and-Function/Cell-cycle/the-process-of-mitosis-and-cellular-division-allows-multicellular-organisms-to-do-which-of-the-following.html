<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In multicellular organisms individual cells grow and then divide via a process called mitosis, thereby allowing the organism to grow.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Mitosis is important to multicellular organisms because it provides new cells for growth and for replacement of worn-out cells, such as skin cells. Many single-celled organisms rely on mitosis as their primary means of asexual reproduction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Multicellular organisms can be much larger and more complex. This is because the cells of the organism have specialised into many different types of cells such as nerve cells, blood cells, muscle cells all performing different functions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-All living things grow and get larger during their lives. Multicellular organisms undergo a process known as development, which requires changes in their cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Mitosis is a fundamental process for life. During mitosis, a cell duplicates all of its contents, including its chromosomes, and splits to form two identical daughter cells.
