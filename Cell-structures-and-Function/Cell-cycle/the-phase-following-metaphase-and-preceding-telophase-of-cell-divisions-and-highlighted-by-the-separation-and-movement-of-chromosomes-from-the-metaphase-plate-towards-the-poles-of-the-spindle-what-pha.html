<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Anaphase is the phase following metaphase and preceding telophase of cell divisions (in both mitosis and meiosis). It is highlighted by the separation and movement of chromosomes from the metaphase plate towards the poles of the spindle.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The spindle fibers from the other side of the cell attach to the other sister chromatids in the chromosome. They attach at a point called the kinetochore, which is a disk or protein that is on each side of the centromere. The spindle fibers will move the chromosomes until they are lined up at the spindle equator.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Metaphase leads to anaphase, during which each chromosomeâ€™s sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles of the cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A structure known as the centrosome duplicates itself to form two daughter centrosomes that migrate to opposite ends of the cell. The centrosomes organise the production of microtubules that form the spindle fibres that constitute the mitotic spindle. The chromosomes condense into compact structures.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Anaphase. After metaphase is complete, the cell enters anaphase. During anaphase, the microtubules attached to the kinetochores contract, which pulls the sister chromatids apart and toward opposite poles of the cell (Figure 3c). At this point, each chromatid is considered a separate chromosome.
