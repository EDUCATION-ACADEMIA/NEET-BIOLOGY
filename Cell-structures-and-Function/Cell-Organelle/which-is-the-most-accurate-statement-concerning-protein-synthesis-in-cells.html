<meta name="description" content="Which is the most accurate statement concerning protein synthesis in cells? Proteins are synthesized at the mitochondria in all living cells.Nearly all the proteins required by cells are synthesised by ribosomes. Ribosomes are found free in the cell cytoplasm and also attached to rough endoplasmic reticulum. Ribosomes receive information from the cell nucleus and construction materials from the cytoplasm.The ribosome is universally responsible for synthesizing proteins by translating the genetic code transcribed in mRNA into an amino acid sequence. Ribosomes use cellular accessory proteins, soluble transfer RNAs, and metabolic energy to accomplish the initiation, elongation, and termination of peptide synthesis.Protein synthesis is the process in which cells make proteins. It occurs in two stages: transcription and translation. Transcription is the transfer of genetic instructions in DNA to mRNA in the nucleus. It includes three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination.Answer and Explanation: The correct answer is A. The sites of protein synthesis are the mitochondria of cells..

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Which is the most accurate statement concerning protein synthesis in cells? Proteins are synthesized at the mitochondria in all living cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Nearly all the proteins required by cells are synthesised by ribosomes. Ribosomes are found ‘free’ in the cell cytoplasm and also attached to rough endoplasmic reticulum. Ribosomes receive information from the cell nucleus and construction materials from the cytoplasm.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The ribosome is universally responsible for synthesizing proteins by translating the genetic code transcribed in mRNA into an amino acid sequence. Ribosomes use cellular accessory proteins, soluble transfer RNAs, and metabolic energy to accomplish the initiation, elongation, and termination of peptide synthesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Protein synthesis is the process in which cells make proteins. It occurs in two stages: transcription and translation. Transcription is the transfer of genetic instructions in DNA to mRNA in the nucleus. It includes three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination.
