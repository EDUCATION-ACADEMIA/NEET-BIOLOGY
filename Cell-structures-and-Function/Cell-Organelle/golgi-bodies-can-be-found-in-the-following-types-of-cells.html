<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The Golgi body can be found in both plants and animals. The Golgi apparatus is found in all plant and animal cells and refers to groups of flattened disc-like structures near the endoplasmic reticulum. Animal cells have fewer but larger Golgi apparatuses. Plant cells can hold up to several hundred smaller versions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The Golgi apparatus (GA), also called Golgi body or Golgi complex and found universally in both plant and animal cells, is typically comprised of a series of five to eight cup-shaped, membrane-covered sacs called cisternae that look something like a stack of deflated balloons.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The Golgi body is a portion of the cell that’s made up of membranes, and there’s different types of membranes. Some of them are tubules, and some of them are vesicles. The Golgi is located right near the nucleus. It’s called a perinuclear body, and it’s actually right near the endoplasmic reticulum as well.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Despite the fact that plant cells have the Golgi, there remains a large difference in our knowledge of animal and plant Golgi. Whereas its role as the protein-sorting centre in the cell has been established by studies on mammalian and yeast cells, our understanding of the plant Golgi has just begun to accumulate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The Golgi apparatus is a series of stacked membranes that are located within the cytoplasm (i.e., gel-like fluid held in the cell membrane) in all eukaryotic cells (i.e., complex cells). It can typically be found adjacent to the nucleus and rough endoplasmic reticulum (an organelle involved in protein synthesis).
