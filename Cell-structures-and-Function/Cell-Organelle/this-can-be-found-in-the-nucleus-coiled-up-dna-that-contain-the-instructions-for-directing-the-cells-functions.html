<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Chromatin Chromatin refers to a mixture of DNA and proteins that form the chromosomes found in the cells of humans and other higher organisms. Many of the proteins-namely, histones-package the massive amount of DNA in a genome into a highly compact form that can fit in the cell nucleus.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Chromosomes and DNA Now that we have a sense of the structure of the nucleus, let’s have a closer look at the genetic information stored inside it: the DNA. Most of an organism’s DNA is organized into one or more chromosomes, each of which is a very long string or loop of DNA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Each chromosome consists of a single, enormously long linear DNA molecule associated with proteins that fold and pack the fine DNA thread into a more compact structure. The complex of DNA and protein is called chromatin (from the Greek chroma, “color, ” because of its staining properties).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In the nucleus of each cell, the DNA molecule is packaged into thread-like structures called chromosomes. Each chromosome is made up of DNA tightly coiled many times around proteins called histones that support its structure.
