<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Hooke detailed his observations of this tiny and previously unseen world in his book, Micrographia. To him, the cork looked as if it was made of tiny pores, which he came to call “cells” because they reminded him of the cells in a monastery.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The invention of the microscope led to the discovery of the cell by Hooke. While looking at cork, Hooke observed box-shaped structures, which he called “cells” as they reminded him of the cells, or rooms, in monasteries. This discovery led to the development of the classical cell theory.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-As you can see, the cork was made up of many tiny units, which Hooke called cells. Cork Cells. This is what Robert Hooke saw when he looked at a thin slice of cork under his microscope.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
