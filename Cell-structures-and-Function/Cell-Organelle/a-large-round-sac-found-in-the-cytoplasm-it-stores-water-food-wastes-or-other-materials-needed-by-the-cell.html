<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Vacuoles are storage bubbles found in cells. They are found in both animal and plant cells but are much larger in plant cells. Vacuoles might store food or any variety of nutrients a cell might need to survive. They can even store waste products so the rest of the cell is protected from contamination.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The vacuole is a large, round sac found in the cytoplasm. It stores water, food, wastes, or other materials needed by the cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Quick look: A vacuole is a membrane-enclosed fluid filled sac found in the cells of plants including fungi. Vacuoles can be large organelles occupying between 30% and 90% of a cell by volume.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A plant cell contains a large, singular vacuole that is used for storage of water and nutrients. It also helps maintain the shape of the cell. In contrast, animal cells have many, smaller vacuoles, which also are used for storage of water and nutrients.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Vacuoles are membrane-bound sacs within the cytoplasm of a cell that function in several different ways. In mature plant cells, vacuoles tend to be very large and are extremely important in providing structural support, as well as serving functions such as storage, waste disposal, protection, and growth.
