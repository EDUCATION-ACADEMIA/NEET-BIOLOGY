<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Organs are structures made up of two or more tissues organized to carry out a particular function, and groups of organs with related functions make up the different organ systems.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An organ is a structure that is composed of at least two or more tissue types and performs a specific set of functions for the body. The liver, stomach, brain, and blood are all different organs and perform different functions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The organ level of organization is when two or more tissues work together for a specific function. For example, the bladder consists of an inner lining of epithelial tissue, bound by various connective tissues to (smooth) muscle.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: An organ is defined as a structure that has a specific structure and is composed of two or more different types of tissues. For example, the stomach is an organ of the digestive system that is made up of multiple tissues such as epithelial, muscle and connective tissue.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-An organ is a group of tissues that together perform a specific function. Heart is an organ made up of cardiac muscle tissue and performs the specific function of pumping blood to all parts of the body.
