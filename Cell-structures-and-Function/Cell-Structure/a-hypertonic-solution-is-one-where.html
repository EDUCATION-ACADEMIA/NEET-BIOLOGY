<meta name="description" content="A solution will be hypertonic to a cell if its solute concentration is higher than that inside the cell, and the solutes cannot cross the membrane. If a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, there will be a net flow of water into the cell, and the cell will gain volume.Hypertonic-A solution is described as a hypertonic solution to a cell if its solute concentration is higher than inside the cell. Thus, the solute is unable to cross the membrane and stays outside. Hence the net flow of the water too is outwards, where there is more solute, causing the cell to lose volume and shrink.Answer and Explanation: When a solution is more concentrated than the inside of a cell, it is said to be hypertonic to the cell. Water will move out of the cell and into the solution by osmosis because of the hypertonicity, as water moves towards areas of higher solute concentration.Hypertonic solutions have a higher solute concentration than inside the cell. This causes water to rush out making the cell wrinkle or shrivel.By contrast, when microorganisms are placed into a hypertonic environment where the concentration of solute is higher outside the cell, water is lost from the cell resulting in dehydration, shrinkage of the plasma membrane and eventual death. This is a process known as plasmolysis.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A solution will be hypertonic to a cell if its solute concentration is higher than that inside the cell, and the solutes cannot cross the membrane. If a cell is placed in a hypotonic solution, there will be a net flow of water into the cell, and the cell will gain volume.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Hypertonic-A solution is described as a hypertonic solution to a cell if its solute concentration is higher than inside the cell. Thus, the solute is unable to cross the membrane and stays outside. Hence the net flow of the water too is outwards, where there is more solute, causing the cell to lose volume and shrink.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: When a solution is more concentrated than the inside of a cell, it is said to be hypertonic to the cell. Water will move out of the cell and into the solution by osmosis because of the hypertonicity, as water moves towards areas of higher solute concentration.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Hypertonic solutions have a higher solute concentration than inside the cell. This causes water to rush out making the cell wrinkle or shrivel.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-By contrast, when microorganisms are placed into a hypertonic environment where the concentration of solute is higher outside the cell, water is lost from the cell resulting in dehydration, shrinkage of the plasma membrane and eventual death. This is a process known as plasmolysis.
