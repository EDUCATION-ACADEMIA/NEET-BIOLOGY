<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Because animals get sugar from the food they eat, they do not need chloroplasts: just mitochondria. Both plant and animal cells have vacuoles. A plant cell contains a large, singular vacuole that is used for storage and maintaining the shape of the cell. In contrast, animal cells have many, smaller vacuoles.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A plant cell contains a large, singular vacuole that is used for storage of water and nutrients. It also helps maintain the shape of the cell. In contrast, animal cells have many, smaller vacuoles, which also are used for storage of water and nutrients.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In animal cells, vacuoles are generally small and help sequester waste products. In plant cells, vacuoles help maintain water balance. Sometimes a single vacuole can take up most of the interior space of the plant cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In plants, a single, large and permanent vacuole is present. It typically occupies 30% to 80% of plant cell volume. It is surrounded by a membrane called tonoplast and is filled with cell sap. In animal cells, vacuoles, if present are small and many.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Plants have large vacuoles. Animals have small-sized vacuoles. They have one large central vacuole. They have two or more small vacuoles.
