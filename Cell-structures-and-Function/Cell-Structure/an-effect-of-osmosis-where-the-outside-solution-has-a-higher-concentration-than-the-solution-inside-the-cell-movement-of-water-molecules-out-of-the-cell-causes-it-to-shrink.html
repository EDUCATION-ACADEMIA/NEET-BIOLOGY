<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Such, solution is said to be hypertonic . In such a case, the water molecules move from inside to the outside of the cell through the cell membrane. This process is called as exosmosis and it occurs when solute concentration inside the cell is lower than outside.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A hypertonic solution is a particular type of solution that has a greater concentration of solutes on the outside of a cell when compared with the inside of a cell. Water crosses the cell membrane in both directions, but more water leaves the cell than enters it. Therefore, the cell will shrink due to exosmosis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A solution will be hypertonic to a cell if its solute concentration is higher than that inside the cell, and the solutes cannot cross the membrane.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Explanation: A hypotonic environment would mean that the concentration of solute is higher inside the cell than outside, or that the concentration of solvent (usually water) is higher outside the cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Final answer: If a solution outside the cell is more concentrated so that the cell loses water to its environment and shrinks the external solution is said to be hypertonic to the cell contents.

</strong>
</p>
<p>When the concentration of solute molecules is higher outside the cell water will move outside the cell what is the environment outside the cell? 
</p>
