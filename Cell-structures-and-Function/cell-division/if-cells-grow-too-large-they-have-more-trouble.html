<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-As the size of a cell increases, its volume increases faster than the surface area. The decrease in the cellâ€™s ratio of surface area to volume makes it more difficult for the cell to move needed materials in and waste products out quickly enough for the cell to survive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-If a cell grows larger, then the volume increases much more rapidly than the surface area, causing the ratio of surface area to volume to decrease. The problem is that the cell would not be able to get enough oxygen and nutrients in and get the waste products out.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The larger a cell gets, the more difficult it is for nutrients and gases to move in and out of the cell. As a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The larger the size of the cell, the larger the volume, and therefore the more time it takes for substances to move through the cell. With larger cells, there is also less plasma membrane available to transport substances in and out of the cell since the surface area is reduced.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-As a cell gets bigger, it has a difficult time keeping up with taking in the extra nutrients it needs and expelling more waste. In other words, as the cell gets bigger, it has less surface area compared to its size-the surface area to volume ratio of the cell decreases as it gets bigger.
