<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-During prophase, changes occur in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In the nucleus, the chromatin fibers become more tightly coiled, condensing into discrete chromosomes observable with a light microscope. The nucleoli disappear. Each duplicated chromosome appears as two identical sister chromatids joined together.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Chromatin condensation begins during prophase (2) and chromosomes become visible.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-During prophase the nucleoli disappear and the chromatin fibers thicken and shorten to form discrete chromosomes visible with the light microscope. Each replicated chromosome appears as two identical chromatids joined at the centromere.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In prophase the chromatin begins to coil and condense to form chromosomes. They are coiling because they are preparing to move around. You can begin to notice that each chromosome appears to have two strands (sister chromatids) and that these sister chromatids are attached to each other at a centromere.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-During prophase, the parent cell chromosomes-which were duplicated during S phase-condense and become thousands of times more compact than they were during interphase.
