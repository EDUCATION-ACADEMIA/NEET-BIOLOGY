<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The centromere appears as a constricted region of a chromosome and plays a key role in helping the cell divide up its DNA during division (mitosis and meiosis). Specifically, it is the region where the cellâ€™s spindle fibers attach.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The centromere links a pair of sister chromatids together during cell division. This constricted region of chromosome connects the sister chromatids, creating a short arm (p) and a long arm (q) on the chromatids. During mitosis, spindle fibers attach to the centromere via the kinetochore.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Functions of Centromeres The main functions include the attachment of sister chromatids, and it is the site for the attachment of spindle fibre. Centromeres help in the proper alignment and segregation of the chromosomes during the process of cell division in eukaryotic cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Kinetochores are protein formations that develop on each chromosome around the centromere, which is a region located near the middle of a chromosome. Other microtubules bind to the chromosome arms or extend to the opposite end of the cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Sister Chromatids Are Joined Together at Centromeres In addition to their kinetochore-related function, centromeres perform another essential role in mitosis by serving as the sites of sister chromatid cohesion. For accurate mitoses, sister chromatids must remain attached until the spindle checkpoint has been passed.
