<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Chromosomes are coiled structures made of DNA and proteins. Chromosomes are the form of the genetic material of a cell during cell division. It is this coiled structure that ensures proper segregation of the chromosomes during cell division. During other phases of the cell cycle, DNA is not coiled into chromosomes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In the nucleus of each cell, the DNA molecule is packaged into thread-like structures called chromosomes. Each chromosome is made up of DNA tightly coiled many times around proteins called histones that support its structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-As shown in the animation, a DNA molecule wraps around histone proteins to form tight loops called nucleosomes. These nucleosomes coil and stack together to form fibers called chromatin. Chromatin, in turn, loops and folds with the help of additional proteins to form chromosomes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The first and longest phase of mitosis is prophase. During prophase, chromatin condenses into chromosomes, and the nuclear envelope (the membrane surrounding the nucleus) breaks down. In animal cells, the centrioles near the nucleus begin to separate and move to opposite poles of the cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Chromatin Chromatin refers to a mixture of DNA and proteins that form the chromosomes found in the cells of humans and other higher organisms. Many of the proteins-namely, histones-package the massive amount of DNA in a genome into a highly compact form that can fit in the cell nucleus.
