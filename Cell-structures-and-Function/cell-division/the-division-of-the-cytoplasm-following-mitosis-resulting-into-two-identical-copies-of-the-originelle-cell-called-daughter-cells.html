<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Mitosis is nuclear division during which duplicated chromosomes are segregated and distributed into daughter nuclei. Usually the cell will divide after mitosis in a process called cytokinesis in which the cytoplasm is divided and two daughter cells are formed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Cytokinesis is the physical process that finally splits the parent cell into two identical daughter cells. During cytokinesis, the cell membrane pinches in at the cell equator, forming a cleft called the cleavage furrow.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Anaphase is the fourth phase of mitosis, the process that separates the duplicated genetic material carried in the nucleus of a parent cell into two identical daughter cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Mitosis and cytokinesis produce two genetically identical daughter cells. Each continuous, double-stranded DNA molecule makes one chromosome. DNA wraps at regular intervals around pro-teins called histones, forming chromatin. Interactions between parts of the histones further compact the DNA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The process by which the cytoplasm of a cell divides to form two two daughter cells is known as cytokinesis.
