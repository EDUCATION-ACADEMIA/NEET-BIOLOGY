<title>Why is it important for the DNA in a cell to replicate?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Explanation: DNA replication needs to occur because existing cells divide to produce new cells. Each cell needs a full instruction manual to operate properly. So the DNA needs to be copied before cell division so that each new cell receives a full set of instructions!Cells must replicate their DNA before they can divide. This ensures that each daughter cell gets a copy of the genome, and therefore, successful inheritance of genetic traits. DNA replication is an essential process and the basic mechanism is conserved in all organisms.Each new cell that is produced must have an exact copy of parental DNA. The daughter strands of DNA are part of a DNA molecule that will be in the daughter cells. This ensures that newly born cells are similar to parents and maintain their genetic identity.The reason why it is important that the product of mitosis, the two daughter cells be genetically identical is to maintain the genetic identity of the somatic cell. Mitosis is a way for the daughter cells to grow and become the same cell type that will perform the same function for that cell.Overview. DNA replication occurs during the S phase (the Synthesis phase) of the cell cycle, before mitosis and cell division. The base pairing rules are crucial for the process of replication. DNA replication occurs when DNA is copied to form an identical molecule of DNA.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Explanation: DNA replication needs to occur because existing cells divide to produce new cells. Each cell needs a full instruction manual to operate properly. So the DNA needs to be copied before cell division so that each new cell receives a full set of instructions!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Cells must replicate their DNA before they can divide. This ensures that each daughter cell gets a copy of the genome, and therefore, successful inheritance of genetic traits. DNA replication is an essential process and the basic mechanism is conserved in all organisms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Each new cell that is produced must have an exact copy of parental DNA. The daughter strands of DNA are part of a DNA molecule that will be in the daughter cells. This ensures that newly born cells are similar to parents and maintain their genetic identity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The reason why it is important that the product of mitosis, the two daughter cells be genetically identical is to maintain the genetic identity of the somatic cell. Mitosis is a way for the daughter cells to grow and become the same cell type that will perform the same function for that cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Overview. DNA replication occurs during the S phase (the Synthesis phase) of the cell cycle, before mitosis and cell division. The base pairing rules are crucial for the process of replication. DNA replication occurs when DNA is copied to form an identical molecule of DNA.
