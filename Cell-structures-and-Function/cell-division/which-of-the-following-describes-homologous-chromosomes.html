Chromosomes that have been inherited from both the parents and which have the same genes arranged in the same order.Answer and Explanation: Homologous chromosomes contain the same genes in the same locations, but the versions of these genes can be different. These different versions are called alleles, meaning the answer is true.The two chromosomes in a homologous pair are very similar to one another and have the same size and shape.

<strong> Which of the following describes homologous chromosomes? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** “one from mom and one from dad” 
</p>
<p>(B) identical copies of each other 
</p>
<p>(C) ** Same “kind” of chromosome, but the exact versions of their genes might be different 
</p>
<p>(D) Chromosome 7 from one parent, chromosome 9 from the other

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The chromosomes in a homologous pair each have the same genes in the same order, but there may be variation between them, resulting in different alleles. Some of the variants in these alleles might have functional implications while others will not.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Which of the following describes homologous chromosomes most accurately? Chromosomes that have been inherited from both the parents and which have the same genes arranged in the same order.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: Homologous chromosomes contain the same genes in the same locations, but the versions of these genes can be different. These different versions are called alleles, meaning the answer is true.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The two chromosomes in a homologous pair are very similar to one another and have the same size and shape. Most importantly, they carry the same type of genetic information: that is, they have the same genes in the same locations. However, they don’t necessarily have the same versions of genes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Different versions of the same variant are called alleles. For example, a SNP may have two alternative bases, or alleles, C and T4.
