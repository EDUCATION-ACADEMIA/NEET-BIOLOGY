<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Cell division ends as the cytoplasm divides into two by the process of cytokinesis. Except for plants, cytokinesis in eucaryotic cells is mediated by a contractile ring, which is composed of actin and myosin filaments and a variety of other proteins.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The final stage of the cell cycle, which is called cytokinesis completes the process of cell division. During cytokinesis, the cytoplasm divides. The organelles are distributed into each of the two new cells. When cytokinesis is complete, two new cells, or daughter cells, have formed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cytokinesis is the final stage of cell division in eukaryotes as well as prokaryotes. During cytokinesis, the cytoplasm splits in two and the cell divides.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Telophase is the fifth and final phase of mitosis, the process that separates the duplicated genetic material carried in the nucleus of a parent cell into two identical daughter cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Mitosis is a fundamental process for life. During mitosis, a cell duplicates all of its contents, including its chromosomes, and splits to form two identical daughter cells.
