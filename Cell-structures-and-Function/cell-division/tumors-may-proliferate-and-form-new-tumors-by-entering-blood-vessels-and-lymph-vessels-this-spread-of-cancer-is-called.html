<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-As a cancerous tumor grows, the bloodstream or lymphatic system may carry cancer cells to other parts of the body. During this process, the cancer cells grow and may develop into new tumors. This is known as metastasis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In metastasis, cancer cells break away from the original (primary) tumor, travel through the blood or lymph system, and form a new tumor in other organs or tissues of the body.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cancer that spreads from where it started to a distant part of the body is called metastatic cancer. For many types of cancer, it is also called stage IV (4) cancer. The process by which cancer cells spread to other parts of the body is called metastasis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Malignant tumors have cells that grow uncontrollably and spread locally and/or to distant sites. Malignant tumors are cancerous (ie, they invade other sites). They spread to distant sites via the bloodstream or the lymphatic system. This spread is called metastasis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Metastasis (M category) Cancer spread to parts of the body far from the primary tumor is known as metastasis. The M category is assigned a number: M0 means that no distant cancer spread has been found. M1 means that the cancer has been found to have spread to distant organs or tissues.
