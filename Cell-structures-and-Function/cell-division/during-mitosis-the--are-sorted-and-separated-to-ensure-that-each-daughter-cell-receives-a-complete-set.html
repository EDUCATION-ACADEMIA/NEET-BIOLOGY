<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-During mitosis, the nuclear envelope (membrane) breaks down and later reforms. The chromosomes are also sorted and separated to ensure that each daughter cell receives a complete set of chromosomes. The second major step is cytokinesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The segregation of the replicated chromosomes is brought about by a complex cytoskeletal machine with many moving parts-the mitotic spindle. It is constructed from microtubules and their associated proteins, which both pull the daughter chromosomes toward the poles of the spindle and move the poles apart.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-At the end of mitosis, the two daughter cells will be exact copies of the original cell. Each daughter cell will have 30 chromosomes. At the end of meiosis II, each cell (i.e., gamete) would have half the original number of chromosomes, that is, 15 chromosomes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Daughter Cells and Chromosome Movement Spindle fibers attach to replicated chromosomes, moving and separating them when appropriate. The mitotic and meiotic spindles move chromosomes to opposite cell poles, ensuring that each daughter cell gets the correct number of chromosomes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Cytokinesis is the physical process of cell division, which divides the cytoplasm of a parental cell into two daughter cells. It occurs concurrently with two types of nuclear division called mitosis and meiosis, which occur in animal cells.
