<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Nonvascular plants, which include mosses, liverworts, and hornworts, lack a system for delivering nutrients inside their bodies. Vascular tissue is made up of vessels known as xylem and phloem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Algae. Algae are a large group of generally aquatic plants. Like bryophytes, algae are nonvascular: They lack the xylem and phloem tissues that transport fluids and nutrients internally. They do not have leaves, roots or flowers, nor do they have rhizoids or leaflike structures like some nonvascular plants.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Bryophytes. Bryophytes have no roots, leaves or stems. Moss and liverworts belong to this group. They are flowerless plants that grow in clumps.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-They not only lack vascular tissues; they also lack true leaves, seeds, and flowers. Instead of roots, they have hair-like rhizoids to anchor them to the ground and to absorb water and minerals (see Figure below).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-1. They’re ancient plants. Mosses are non-flowering plants which produce spores and have stems and leaves, but don’t have true roots.
