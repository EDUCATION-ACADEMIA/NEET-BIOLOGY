<strong> Where do enveloped viruses get their envelope?

<p>(A) They are created when the viral DNA is created

<p>(B) ** from the host’s cell membrane 
</p>
<p>(C) They build them after they leave the host cell 
</p>
<p>(D) none of these options

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-This envelope comes from the infected cell, or host, in a process called “budding off.” During the budding process, newly formed virus particles become “enveloped” or wrapped in an outer coat that is made from a small piece of the cell’s plasma membrane.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) typically are released from the host cell by budding. During this process the virus acquires its envelope, which is a modified piece of the host’s plasma or other, internal membrane.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The envelopes are typically derived from portions of the host cell membranes (phospholipids and proteins), but include some viral glycoproteins. One of the main parts of human pathogenic viruses is glycoprotein. They have been shown to play significant roles in immunity and infection.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Lipid enveloped viruses contain a lipid bilayer coat that protects their genome to help facilitate entry into the new host cell. This lipid bilayer comes from the host cell which they infect. After viral replication, the mature virion hijacks the host cell plasma membrane where it is then released to infect new cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Enveloped viruses-In the maturation of enveloped viruses, a capsid must first be assembled around the nucleic acid to form the nucleocapsid, which is then surrounded by the envelope. During the assembly of the nucleocapsid, virus-coded envelope proteins are also synthesized.
