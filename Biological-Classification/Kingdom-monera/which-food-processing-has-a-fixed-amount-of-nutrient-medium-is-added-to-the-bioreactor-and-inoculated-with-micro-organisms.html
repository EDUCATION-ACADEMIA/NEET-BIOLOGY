<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In batch fermentation, microorganisms are inoculated to a fixed volume of medium in a fermentor. With microbial growth, the nutrients are gradually consumed and by-products accumulate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In the batch method, extra nutrients are not supplied till the end of the process. In a fed-batch culture, nutrients are added systematically for an extended duration, unlike in a continuous batch where nutrients are added, and products are removed continuously.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Fixed volume fed-batch In this type of fed-batch, the limiting substrate is fed without diluting the culture. The culture volume can also be maintained practically constant by feeding the growth limiting substrate in undiluted form, for example, as a very concentrated liquid or gas (ex. oxygen).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Batch fermentation is a process where all the substrate and nutrients are added at zero time or soon after inoculation takes place, and the vessel is allowed under a controlled environment to proceed until maximum end product concentration is achieved.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The fed-batch process differs from the traditional batch process in that nutrients are added in stages to maximize cell growth. The bioreactor is filled with a base amount of media to support initial cell growth. Feed media is added when needed to replace nutrients depleted by the increasing cell population.
