Explanation: Interferons (INFs) are a group of three vertebrate glycoproteins (α, β, γ ) (out of these, two (α and β) are produced within virally infected cells. Interferon act as antiviral protein by inducing synthesis of the enzymes which inhibit the viral production cycle.Interferons are a family of structurally related, species-specific proteins that enhance the immune system released by host cells in response to the presence of pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, and tumor cells.Solution: Virus-infected cells secrete proteins called interferons which protect non-infected cells from further viral infection.Interferons are antiviral proteins synthesized by many kinds of somatic cells in response to viral infection.">
