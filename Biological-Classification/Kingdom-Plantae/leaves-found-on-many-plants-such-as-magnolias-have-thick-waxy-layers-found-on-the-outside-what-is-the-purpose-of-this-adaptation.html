<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-It is made up of cutin which is secreted by the epidermis of the leaf. A primary function of the waxy cuticle is to reduce water loss through the surface of the leaves, which is particularly important in water deficient areas like deserts which receives very little rainfall.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-To reduce water loss the leaf is coated in a waxy cuticle to stop the water vapour escaping through the epidermis. Leaves usually have fewer stomata on their top surface to reduce this water loss. Leaves enable photosynthesis to occur.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Leaves are covered by a waxy cuticle on the outer surface that prevents the loss of water. Plants that grow in dry environments and plants that grow on other plants (epiphytes) have a much thicker waxy cuticle than those growing in more moderate, well-watered environments (Figure 17.1.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Adaptation such as spines, thick cuticles, and sunken stomata helps the plant to reduce the rate of transpiration.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Some desert plants store water in their leaves, stems, or roots. Others have thick, waxy skin that helps prevent water loss. Some desert plants have small leaves that help reduce evaporation. Others have deep taproots that help them reach the underground water sources.
