<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Traditional classification He divided the natural world into 3 kingdoms and used five ranks: class, order, genus, species, and variety. He also introduced the system of binomial nomenclature, in which every species has an internationally recognized two-part name.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Taxonomy is the study of relationships between living things and the formal classification of organisms into groups based upon those hypothesized relationships. Organisms are classified based upon their similarities and differences. Think about your own biological relatives.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A species is a group of organisms that can mate, or interbreed. They can produce offspring that can also reproduce. A species is the smallest group into which organisms are classified.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Original Linnaean Classification System Domains were divided into kingdoms, which were broken into phyla (singular: phylum) for animals and divisions for plants and fungi. Phyla or divisions were broken into classes, which in turn were divided into orders, families, genera (singular: genus), and species.
