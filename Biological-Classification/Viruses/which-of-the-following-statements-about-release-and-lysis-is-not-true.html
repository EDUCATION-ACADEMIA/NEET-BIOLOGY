<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Lysis is actively induced by many viruses to release viral particles previously assembled into the host cell. Lytic replication: Most non-enveloped virus, and few enveloped viruses require cell lysis in order to release new virions from the infected cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The release of phage progeny from an infected bacterium is necessary for the spread of infection. Only helical phages are secreted from a cell without causing its destruction. The release of remaining phages is correlated with bacterial lysis and death.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Viruses can be released from the host cell by lysis, a process that kills the cell by bursting its membrane and cell wall if present. This is a feature of many bacterial and some animal viruses.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In the lytic cycle, the virus attaches to the host cell and injects its DNA. Using the host’s cellular metabolism, the viral DNA begins to replicate and form proteins. Then fully formed viruses assemble. These viruses break, or lyse, the cell and spread to other cells to continue the cycle.
