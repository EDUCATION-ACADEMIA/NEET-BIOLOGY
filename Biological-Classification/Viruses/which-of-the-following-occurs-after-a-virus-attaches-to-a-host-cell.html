<title>Which of the following occurs after a virus attaches to a host cell
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Viruses cannot replicate on their own, but rather depend on their host cells protein synthesis pathways to reproduce. This typically occurs by the virus inserting its genetic material in host cells, co-opting the proteins to create viral replicates, until the cell bursts from the high volume of new viral particles.In the lytic cycle, the virus attaches to the host cell and injects its DNA. Using the hosts cellular metabolism, the viral DNA begins to replicate and form proteins. Then fully formed viruses assemble. These viruses break, or lyse, the cell and spread to other cells to continue the cycle.During attachment and penetration, the virus attaches itself to a host cell and injects its genetic material into it. During uncoating, replication, and assembly, the viral DNA or RNA incorporates itself into the host cells genetic material and induces it to replicate the viral genome.To infect a cell, it is critical that a virus initiates attachment-the binding of the virus to the host cell. This interaction is specific: the virus contains a virus attachment protein that adsorbs to a cell surface receptor on the cell (Table 4.1 ).Attachment proteins of enveloped viruses are generally spike-like and extend from the surface of the virion allowing the attachment protein to serve as the first point of contact with the receptor on the plasma membrane [1].">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Viruses cannot replicate on their own, but rather depend on their host cell’s protein synthesis pathways to reproduce. This typically occurs by the virus inserting its genetic material in host cells, co-opting the proteins to create viral replicates, until the cell bursts from the high volume of new viral particles.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In the lytic cycle, the virus attaches to the host cell and injects its DNA. Using the host’s cellular metabolism, the viral DNA begins to replicate and form proteins. Then fully formed viruses assemble. These viruses break, or lyse, the cell and spread to other cells to continue the cycle.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-During attachment and penetration, the virus attaches itself to a host cell and injects its genetic material into it. During uncoating, replication, and assembly, the viral DNA or RNA incorporates itself into the host cell’s genetic material and induces it to replicate the viral genome.
