<title>Which of the following occurs after a virus attaches to a host cell in the viral reproduction process?

<meta name="description" content="After gaining entry into the body, a virus makes physical contact with and crosses the plasma membrane of a target cell.

How this is carried out depends upon the type of viral nucleic acid.During attachment and penetration, the virus attaches itself to a host cell and injects its genetic material into it. During uncoating, replication, and assembly, the viral DNA or RNA incorporates itself into the host cells genetic material and induces it to replicate the viral genome.The viruss genome is uncoated from the protein and injected into the host cell. Then the viral genome hijacks the host cells machinery, forcing it to replicate the viral genome and produce viral proteins to make new capsids. Next, the viral particles are assembled into new viruses.It has been known for decades that once a virus gets inside a cell, it hijacks the cellular processes to produce virally encoded protein that will replicate the viruss genetic material.The first stage, attachment, involves viral proteins binding to the host cell surface.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-After gaining entry into the body, a virus makes physical contact with and crosses the plasma membrane of a target cell. Inside, it releases and replicates its genome while facilitating the manufacture of its proteins by host ribosomes. How this is carried out depends upon the type of viral nucleic acid.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-During attachment and penetration, the virus attaches itself to a host cell and injects its genetic material into it. During uncoating, replication, and assembly, the viral DNA or RNA incorporates itself into the host cell’s genetic material and induces it to replicate the viral genome.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The virus’s genome is uncoated from the protein and injected into the host cell. Then the viral genome hijacks the host cell’s machinery, forcing it to replicate the viral genome and produce viral proteins to make new capsids. Next, the viral particles are assembled into new viruses.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-It has been known for decades that once a virus gets inside a cell, it hijacks the cellular processes to produce virally encoded protein that will replicate the virus’s genetic material.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The first stage, attachment, involves viral proteins binding to the host cell surface. There, they interact with receptors specific to them and their host cells. The specificity of viral attachment is a key decider of the range of hosts a virus can affect. This is also known as the tropism of a virus.
