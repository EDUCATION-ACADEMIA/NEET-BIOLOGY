<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Still, viruses have some important features in common with cell-based life. For instance, they have nucleic acid genomes based on the same genetic code thatâ€™s used in your cells (and the cells of all living creatures). Also, like cell-based life, viruses have genetic variation and can evolve.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Viruses have several common characteristics: they are small, have DNA or RNA genomes, and are obligate intracellular parasites. The virus capsid functions to protect the nucleic acid from the environment, and some viruses surround their capsid with a membrane envelope.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Viruses do, however, show some characteristics of living things. They are made of proteins and glycoproteins like cells are. They contain genetic information needed to produce more viruses in the form of DNA or RNA. They evolve to adapt to their hosts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Though viruses are not considered living, they share two important traits with living organisms. They have genetic material like all cells do (though they are not made of cells), and they can evolve.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The simplest virions consist of two basic components: nucleic acid (single-or double-stranded RNA or DNA) and a protein coat, the capsid, which functions as a shell to protect the viral genome from nucleases and which during infection attaches the virion to specific receptors exposed on the prospective host cell.
