<strong> Viruses use two different cycles of replication, the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle. In what way is the lysogenic cycle different from the lytic cycle? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The virus recognizes and attaches to host cell. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** The host cell is not destroyed immediately. 
</p>
<p>(C) Viral DNA is replicated along with host DNA. 
</p>
<p>(D) The virus injects its DNA into the host cell.. 
</p>
<p>
<div style ="text-align:center">
<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The difference between lysogenic and lytic cycles is that, in lysogenic cycles, the spread of the viral DNA occurs through the usual prokaryotic reproduction, whereas a lytic cycle is more immediate in that it results in many copies of the virus being created very quickly and the cell is destroyed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The lytic cycle is different from the lysogenic cycle because the lytic cycle causes the death of the infected cell due to lysis, while the lysogenic cycle does not kill the cell. Viruses known as bacteriophages infect bacteria, and many can undergo both types of cycles.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The lytic cycle leads to the death of the host, whereas the lysogenic cycle leads to integration of phage into the host genome. Bacteriophages inject DNA into the host cell, whereas animal viruses enter by endocytosis or membrane fusion. Animal viruses can undergo latency, similar to lysogeny for a bacteriophage.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-What is the main difference between a lytic and lysogenic cycle? In the lytic cycle, the viral genome does not incorporate into the host genome. In the lysogenic cycle, the viral genome incorporates into the host genome and stays there throughout replication until the lytic cycle is triggered.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The lytic cycle, or virulent infection, involves a virus taking control of a host cell and using it to produce its viral progeny, killing the host in the process.
