Alfred Sturtevant explained that the recombination frequency between gene pairs is the measure of distance between the genes. He said that the recombination frequency is inversely proportional to the distance between the genes.The basic reason is that crossovers between two genes that are close together are not very common. Crossovers during meiosis happen at more or less random positions along the chromosome, so the frequency of crossovers between two genes depends on the distance between them.It follows that: • the probability of a crossover between two genes is proportional to the distance between the two genes. That is, the greater the distance between the two genes, the greater the probability that a crossover will occur between them during meiosis.A recombination frequency of 50% is therefore the maximum recombination frequency that can be observed, and is indicative of loci that are either on separate chromosomes, or are located very far apart on the same chromosome.The frequency with which a single chromosomal crossing occurs between two genes during meiosis is referred to as recombination frequency. The order of entry for each gene is determined by the recombination frequency, which assesses the genetic linkage utilised to generate a genetic linkage map.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The frequency of recombination is the number of crossovers formed between any two genes. Alfred Sturtevant explained that the recombination frequency between gene pairs is the measure of distance between the genes. He said that the recombination frequency is inversely proportional to the distance between the genes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The basic reason is that crossovers between two genes that are close together are not very common. Crossovers during meiosis happen at more or less random positions along the chromosome, so the frequency of crossovers between two genes depends on the distance between them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-It follows that: • the probability of a crossover between two genes is proportional to the distance between the two genes. That is, the greater the distance between the two genes, the greater the probability that a crossover will occur between them during meiosis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A recombination frequency of 50% is therefore the maximum recombination frequency that can be observed, and is indicative of loci that are either on separate chromosomes, or are located very far apart on the same chromosome.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The frequency with which a single chromosomal crossing occurs between two genes during meiosis is referred to as recombination frequency. The order of entry for each gene is determined by the recombination frequency, which assesses the genetic linkage utilised to generate a genetic linkage map.
