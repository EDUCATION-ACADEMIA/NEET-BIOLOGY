<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Leaves in the form of spines mean that there is a lesser surface area of the leaf to lose water by transpiration. Thus, spines help them to reduce water loss.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The leaves of cactus are modified into spines, to prevent water loss from the surface of leaves. The green stem of the cactus plant contains chlorophyll. Thus, the stem is the centre of photosynthesis in the cactus plants instead of the leaves. Q.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In the desert, water is scarce. More leaves mean more stomata and more water loss through transpiration. If the plants have reduced leaves or no leaves at all, it will reduce the surface area and the number of stomata. Therefore, leaves in desert plants get modified into spines.
