<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Genes that are present on separate, non-homologous chromosomes always sort independently. The principle of independent assortment states that non-homologous chromosomes are sorted independently of one another during meiosis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-So, the correct answer is ‘Homologous chromosomes’
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-When cells divide during meiosis, homologous chromosomes are randomly distributed to daughter cells, and different chromosomes segregate independently of each other. This called is called independent assortment. It results in gametes that have unique combinations of chromosomes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Independent assortment is the process where the chromosomes move randomly to separate poles during meiosis. A gamete will end up with 23 chromosomes after meiosis, but independent assortment means that each gamete will have 1 of many different combinations of chromosomes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The law of independent assortment applies only to factor or genes present on different pairs or distantly on the same chromosome or pairs of homologous chromosomes.
