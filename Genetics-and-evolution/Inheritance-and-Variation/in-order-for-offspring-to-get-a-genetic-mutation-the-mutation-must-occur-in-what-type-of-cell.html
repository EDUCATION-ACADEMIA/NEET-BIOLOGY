<strong> In order for offspring to get a genetic mutation, the mutation must occur in what type of cell? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Cells with no nucleus. 
</p>
<p>(B) Any body cell after birth. 
</p>
<p>(C) Cells with no cell wall or cell membrane.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-If a mutation occurs in a germ-line cell (one that will give rise to gametes, i.e., egg or sperm cells), then this mutation can be passed to an organism’s offspring.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-If a parent carries a gene mutation in their egg or sperm, it can pass to their child. These hereditary (or inherited) mutations are in almost every cell of the person’s body throughout their life. Hereditary mutations include cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, and sickle cell disease.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A gene change in a body’s reproductive cell (egg or sperm) that becomes incorporated into the DNA of every cell in the body of the offspring. Germline mutations are passed on from parents to offspring.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Germline mutations occur in a parent’s reproductive cells (egg or sperm). These mutations change the genetic material that the child receives from their parent (hereditary).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The only mutations that matter to large-scale evolution are those that can be passed on to offspring. These occur in reproductive cells like eggs and sperm and are called germ line mutations.
