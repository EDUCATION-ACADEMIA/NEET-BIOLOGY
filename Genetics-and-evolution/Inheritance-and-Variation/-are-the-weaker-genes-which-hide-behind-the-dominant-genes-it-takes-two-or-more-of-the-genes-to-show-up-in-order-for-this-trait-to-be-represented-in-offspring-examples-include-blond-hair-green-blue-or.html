<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Codominance. As opposed to partial dominance, codominance occurs when the phenotypes of both parents are simultaneously expressed in the same offspring organism.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Genes can come in 2 different forms called alleles. We represent alleles with both lowercase and uppercase letters. Uppercase and lowercase letters are used to show which alleles are dominant and which are recessive. A dominant (uppercase letter) allele will overpower a recessive allele (lowercase letter).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-One allele for every gene in an organism is inherited from each of that organism’s parents. In some cases, both parents provide the same allele of a given gene, and the offspring is referred to as homozygous ("homo” meaning “same") for that allele.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Genetics is the scientific study of genes and heredity-of how certain qualities or traits are passed from parents to offspring as a result of changes in DNA sequence.
