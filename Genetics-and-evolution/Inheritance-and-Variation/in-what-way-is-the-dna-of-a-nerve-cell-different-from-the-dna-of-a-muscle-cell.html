</title>
<meta name="description" content="Compared to DNA in other cells, neurons have more, less and rearranged DNA. And these changes accumulate over time.Although all cells contain the same DNA sequence, muscle cells are different from nerve cells and other types of cells because of the different genes that are turned on in these cells and the different RNAs and proteins produced.These cells are different because they use the same set of genes differently. So even though each of our cells has the same 20, 000 or so genes, each cell can select which ones it wants to turn on and which ones it wants to keep turned off.The muscle cell and nerve cell inherit different DNA sequences. Transcription of different genes leads to the synthesis of different proteins in the two cell types. The chromosomal DNA is rearranged and mutated so that the cell can become a muscle cell instead of a nerve cell.">

<strong> In what way is the DNA of a nerve cell different from the DNA of a muscle cell? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The DNA is the same but each cell contains different genes 
</p>
<p>(B) ** The DNA is the same but different genes are turned on in each cell 
</p>
<p>(C) Each cell has its own unique DNA 
</p>
<p>(D) The DNA is different, but each cell contains the same genes 
</p>
<p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Compared to DNA in other cells, neurons have more, less and rearranged DNA. And these changes accumulate over time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Although all cells contain the same DNA sequence, muscle cells are different from nerve cells and other types of cells because of the different genes that are turned on in these cells and the different RNAs and proteins produced.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-These cells are different because they use the same set of genes differently. So even though each of our cells has the same 20, 000 or so genes, each cell can select which ones it wants to “turn on” and which ones it wants to keep “turned off”.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The muscle cell and nerve cell inherit different DNA sequences. Transcription of different genes leads to the synthesis of different proteins in the two cell types. The chromosomal DNA is rearranged and mutated so that the cell can become a muscle cell instead of a nerve cell.
