<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-An individual with one dominant and one recessive allele for a gene will have the dominant phenotype. They are generally considered “carriers” of the recessive allele: the recessive allele is there, but the recessive phenotype is not.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Organisms that have one dominant and one recessive allele, such as the Pp pea plants, are called heterozygous.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Codominance. Codominance refers to the dominance in which the two alleles or traits of the genotypes (of both homozygotes) are expressed together in offspring (phenotype). There is neither a dominant nor recessive allele in cross-breeding.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The genotype is considered heterozygous when an individual has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. Note that genetic inheritance is complex and cannot always be explained in this simple manner-some people have green eyes, for example, and or one blue eye and one brown eye (heterochromia iridum).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Incomplete dominance is when a dominant allele, or form of a gene, does not completely mask the effects of a recessive allele, and the organism’s resulting physical appearance shows a blending of both alleles. It is also called semi-dominance or partial dominance.
