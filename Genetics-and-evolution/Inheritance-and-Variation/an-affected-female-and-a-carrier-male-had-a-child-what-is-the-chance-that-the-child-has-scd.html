<title>An affected female and a carrier male had a child, what is the chance that the child has SCD?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="How Sickle Cell Trait is Inherited. If both parents have SCT, there is a 50% (or 1 in 2) chance that any child of theirs also will have SCT, if the child inherits the sickle cell gene from one of the parents. Such children will not have symptoms of SCD, but they can pass SCT on to their children.1 in 4 chance each child they have will inherit copies of the sickle cell gene from both parents and will be born with sickle cell disease.However, men with SCD are more likely to experience infertility because of hypogonadism (testosterone deficiency), sperm abnormalities, and erectile dysfunction. Up to 24 percent of adult men with SCD experience hypogonadism. This is a condition where the body does not produce enough testosterone, sperm, or both.Your child would have to inherit two sickle cell genes to have sickle cell disease. So if your childs father does not have the sickle cell gene, your child cant get sickle cell disease. But if your childs father has the sickle cell gene, your child can get sickle cell disease.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-How Sickle Cell Trait is Inherited. If both parents have SCT, there is a 50% (or 1 in 2) chance that any child of theirs also will have SCT, if the child inherits the sickle cell gene from one of the parents. Such children will not have symptoms of SCD, but they can pass SCT on to their children.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-1 in 4 chance each child they have will inherit copies of the sickle cell gene from both parents and will be born with sickle cell disease.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-However, men with SCD are more likely to experience infertility because of hypogonadism (testosterone deficiency), sperm abnormalities, and erectile dysfunction. Up to 24 percent of adult men with SCD experience hypogonadism. This is a condition where the body does not produce enough testosterone, sperm, or both.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Your child would have to inherit two sickle cell genes to have sickle cell disease. So if your child’s father does not have the sickle cell gene, your child can’t get sickle cell disease. But if your child’s father has the sickle cell gene, your child can get sickle cell disease.
