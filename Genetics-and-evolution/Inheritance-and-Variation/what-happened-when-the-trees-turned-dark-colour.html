<title>What happened when the trees turned dark colour?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="The black colour of the dark form was due to the mutation in the DNA of the light-coloured form. Once this mutation was present, the dark-coloured moths would produce offspring with the dark-coloured wings. Hence, the correct answer is an option (C).As the trees darkened with soot, the light-colored moths were easier to see. They were eaten by birds more and more, while the rare dark colored moths blended in better on the darker trees. This made the dark colored moths have a higher survival rate.He found that on dark tree trunks, birds were twice as likely to eat a light moth as a dark moth. The same birds would find the dark moth twice as often if the bark on the tree was light. This supported the idea that dark moths had a survival advantage in a dark forest.Genetic Changes Moths passed their color to the next generation. Eggs from light moths developed into light moths and dark moth eggs turned to dark adults. The dark color was caused by a mutation in the DNA of a single moth, and the mutated gene had been passed to all its offspring.Rather than cause the black color mutation, the sooty conditions of the Industrial Revolution created the perfect backdrop for black moths to survive. As soot covered surfaces throughout Britain, black moths blended in with their background, escaping notice by predators and thriving.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The black colour of the dark form was due to the mutation in the DNA of the light-coloured form. Once this mutation was present, the dark-coloured moths would produce offspring with the dark-coloured wings. Hence, the correct answer is an option (C).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-As the trees darkened with soot, the light-colored moths were easier to see. They were eaten by birds more and more, while the rare dark colored moths blended in better on the darker trees. This made the dark colored moths have a higher survival rate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-He found that on dark tree trunks, birds were twice as likely to eat a light moth as a dark moth. The same birds would find the dark moth twice as often if the bark on the tree was light. This supported the idea that dark moths had a survival advantage in a dark forest.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Genetic Changes Moths passed their color to the next generation. Eggs from light moths developed into light moths and dark moth eggs turned to dark adults. The dark color was caused by a mutation in the DNA of a single moth, and the mutated gene had been passed to all its offspring.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Rather than cause the black color mutation, the sooty conditions of the Industrial Revolution created the perfect backdrop for black moths to survive. As soot covered surfaces throughout Britain, black moths blended in with their background, escaping notice by predators and thriving.
