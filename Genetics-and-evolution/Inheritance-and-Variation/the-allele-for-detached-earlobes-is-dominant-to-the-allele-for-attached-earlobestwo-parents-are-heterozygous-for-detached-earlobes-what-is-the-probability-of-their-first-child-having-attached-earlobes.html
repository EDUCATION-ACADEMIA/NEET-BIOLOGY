<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Final answer: There is a 25% chance that the next child will have attached earlobes.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A single autosomal gene with two alleles determines whether you have attached earlobes or free-hanging earlobes. The allele for free-hanging earlobes (F) is dominant to the allele for attached earlobes (f). Other single-gene autosomal traits include widow’s peak and hitchhiker’s thumb.
