A change in the nucleotide sequence of DNA, which may or may not manifest in a phenotype, is called a mutation.Inherited (or hereditary) variants are passed from parent to child and are present throughout a persons life in virtually every cell in the body. These variants are also called germline variants because they are present in the parents egg or sperm cells, which are also called germ cells.Genetics and genomics both play roles in health and disease. Genetics refers to the study of genes and the way that certain traits or conditions are passed down from one generation to another.
