<strong> A genetic mutation causes a newt to have faster reflexes. After many generations, most of the newt population has the reflex mutation. Which of the following most likely caused this change? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** Newts with the mutation are better able to survive and reproduce than newts without the mutation. 
</p>
<p>(B) The mutation was contagious.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A genetic mutation causes a newt to have faster reflexes. After many generations, most of the newt population has the reflex mutation. What is most likely to have caused this change? Newts with the mutation are better able to survive and reproduce than newts without the mutation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In order for a genetic mutation in a species to result in the formation of a new species, what must occur? The new species must be unable to breed with the original species.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Mutations in a gene can result in a change in the sequence of amino acids such as in frameshift mutations and in missense and nonsense mutations occurring in point mutations. However, point mutations can also lead to silent mutations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Mutations in somatic cells are called somatic mutations. Because they do not occur in cells that give rise to gametes, the mutation is not passed along to the next generation by sexual means.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Germ-line mutations occur in gametes or in cells that eventually produce gametes. In contrast with somatic mutations, germ-line mutations are passed on to an organismâ€™s progeny. As a result, future generations of organisms will carry the mutation in all of their cells (both somatic and germ-line).
