<title>A plant species lives in an area with limited sunlight. Which structure would be most helpful to the plant to help it survive?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Answer:Large Leaves Leave are the part of a plant that contains chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are structures that contain chlorophyll, a pigment that captures sunlight and allows the plant to make sugars. The larger the leaf surface a plant has, the more sunlight it can capture.Some plants can survive in very low-light conditions. If you think about dark, rainforest canopies, there are plants that grow in that environment. They have evolutionary adaptations to handle these low-light environments, which include making broad, thin leaves to capture as much sunlight as they can.In particular, organelles called chloroplasts allow plants to capture the energy of the Sun in energy-rich molecules; cell walls allow plants to have rigid structures as varied as wood trunks and supple leaves; and vacuoles allow plant cells to change size.Inside the plant cell are small organelles called chloroplasts, which store the energy of sunlight. Within the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast is a light-absorbing pigment called chlorophyll, which is responsible for giving the plant its green color.In leaves, cells in the mesophyll (the tissue between the upper and lower epidermis) are uniquely suited to carry out photosynthesis on a large scale. This is due to their high concentration of chloroplasts, which are the sites of photosynthesis. More chloroplasts means more photosynthetic capability.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Answer:Large Leaves Leave are the part of a plant that contains chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are structures that contain chlorophyll, a pigment that captures sunlight and allows the plant to make sugars. The larger the leaf surface a plant has, the more sunlight it can capture.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Some plants can survive in very low-light conditions. If you think about dark, rainforest canopies, there are plants that grow in that environment. They have evolutionary adaptations to handle these low-light environments, which include making broad, thin leaves to capture as much sunlight as they can.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In particular, organelles called chloroplasts allow plants to capture the energy of the Sun in energy-rich molecules; cell walls allow plants to have rigid structures as varied as wood trunks and supple leaves; and vacuoles allow plant cells to change size.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Inside the plant cell are small organelles called chloroplasts, which store the energy of sunlight. Within the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast is a light-absorbing pigment called chlorophyll, which is responsible for giving the plant its green color.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In leaves, cells in the mesophyll (the tissue between the upper and lower epidermis) are uniquely suited to carry out photosynthesis on a large scale. This is due to their high concentration of chloroplasts, which are the sites of photosynthesis. More chloroplasts means more photosynthetic capability.
