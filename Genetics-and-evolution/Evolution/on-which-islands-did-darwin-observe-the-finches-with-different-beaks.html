<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Out of the 14 finches observed by Darwin, 13 were from the Galapagos island, and one was from the Cocos island. These finches evolved from a common ancestor to have different beaks well-suited for different types of food they feed on.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-On his visit to the Galapagos Islands, Charles Darwin discovered several species of finches that varied from island to island which helped him to develop his theory of natural selection. He observed that the shape of the beak of the birds varied according to the type of food they consume.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-On the Galápagos, finches evolved based on different food sources-long, pointed beaks served well for snatching insects while broad, blunt beaks work best for cracking seeds and nuts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In Galapagos he found a remarkable population of plants, birds and reptiles that had developed in isolation from the mainland, but often differed on almost identical islands next door to one another and whose characteristics he could only explain by a gradual transformation of the various species.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Darwin’s finches are small birds which were studied by Darwin on Galapagos island. The original ancestral species of Darwin’s finch were seed eating types.
