<title>Similar structure and function of a body structure but NO Common ancestry (Not related)
</title>
<meta name="description" content="The correct answer is (c) analogous structures. Analogous structures are defined as traits or structures that are similar in two different species, but were not inherited from a common evolutionary ancestor. That is, the structures evolved independently but are similar because of shared selective pressures.What Are Analogous Structures? Analogous structures are similar structures in unrelated organisms. These structures are similar because they do the same job, not because they share common ancestry. For example, dolphins and sharks both have fins, even though they arent related.Homologous Structures. The structures derived from a common ancestor or from the same evolutionary or developmental origin are referred to as homologous structures. Homologous structures may not necessarily perform the same function. An example of homologous structures is the forelimbs of humans and bats.On the opposite side of the spectrum, analogous structures are similar physical features in organisms that do not share a common ancestor. Instead, these structures are related to one another because they perform the same function. An example of this are the wings of a bat and the wings of a bird.The opposite of homologous structures are analogous structures, which are physically similar structures between two taxa that evolved separately (rather than being present in the last common ancestor). Bat wings and bird wings evolved independently and are considered analogous structures.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The correct answer is (c) analogous structures. Analogous structures are defined as traits or structures that are similar in two different species, but were not inherited from a common evolutionary ancestor. That is, the structures evolved independently but are similar because of shared selective pressures.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-What Are Analogous Structures? Analogous structures are similar structures in unrelated organisms. These structures are similar because they do the same job, not because they share common ancestry. For example, dolphins and sharks both have fins, even though they arenâ€™t related.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Homologous Structures. The structures derived from a common ancestor or from the same evolutionary or developmental origin are referred to as homologous structures. Homologous structures may not necessarily perform the same function. An example of homologous structures is the forelimbs of humans and bats.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-On the opposite side of the spectrum, analogous structures are similar physical features in organisms that do not share a common ancestor. Instead, these structures are related to one another because they perform the same function. An example of this are the wings of a bat and the wings of a bird.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The opposite of homologous structures are analogous structures, which are physically similar structures between two taxa that evolved separately (rather than being present in the last common ancestor). Bat wings and bird wings evolved independently and are considered analogous structures.
