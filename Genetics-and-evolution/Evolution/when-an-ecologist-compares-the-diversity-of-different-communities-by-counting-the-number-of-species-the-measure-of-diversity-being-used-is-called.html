<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Alpha diversity refers to diversity within a particular area, community or ecosystem, and is usually measured by counting the number of taxa within the ecosystem (usually species level).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A diversity index is a quantitative measure that reflects how many different types (such as species) there are in a dataset (a community).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Species richness represents a measure of the variety of species based simply on a count of the number of species in a particular sample, although it can be expressed more usefully as species richness pre unit area, ranging from alpha (referring to a certain site) to gamma (for an entire study area) level.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Species richness is simply the number of species in a community. Species diversity is more complex, and includes a measure of the number of species in a community, and a measure of the abundance of each species.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-To measure species richness you simply count the number of different species present.To measure species evenness you count the number of different species present and the number of individuals of each species (basically any sampling method that takes into account the abundance of each species).
