<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-An adaptation is any heritable trait that helps an organism, such as a plant or animal, survive and reproduce in its environment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An adaptive trait is, then, an aspect of the developmental pattern which facilitates the survival and/or reproduction of its carrier in a certain succession of environments.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A heritable trait that aids the survival and reproduction of an organism in its present environment is called an adaptation. An adaptation is a “match” of the organism to the environment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Natural selection is the process through which populations of living organisms adapt and change. Individuals in a population are naturally variable, meaning that they are all different in some ways. This variation means that some individuals have traits better suited to the environment than others.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-An adaptation can be structural, meaning it is a physical part of the organism. An adaptation can also be behavioral, affecting the way an organism responds to its environment. An example of a structural adaptation is the way some plants have adapted to life in dry, hot deserts.
