<strong> Which of the following is the definition for speciation? 
</strong>
<p>(A) an inherited or learned trait that increases an organismâ€™s chance of survival in its environment 
</p>
<p>(B) ** the evolutionary process through which new species emerge 
</p>
<p>(C) a process by which organisms that are better adapted to their environment tend to survive, reproduce, increase in number, and pass their traits on to succeeding generations 
</p>
<p>(D) a process by which one of the extreme variations of a trait is favored

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Speciation occurs when a group within a species separates from other members of its species and develops its own unique characteristics. The demands of a different environment or the characteristics of the members of the new group will differentiate the new species from their ancestors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-New species arise through a process called speciation. In speciation, an ancestral species splits into two or more descendant species that are genetically different from one another and can no longer interbreed. Darwin envisioned speciation as a branching event.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Speciation is the formation of one or more new species from an existing species.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Sympatric speciation: the new species evolves within the geographic range of its ancestor.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Explanation: Speciation is the event that occurs when two populations of a particular species can no longer interbreed.
