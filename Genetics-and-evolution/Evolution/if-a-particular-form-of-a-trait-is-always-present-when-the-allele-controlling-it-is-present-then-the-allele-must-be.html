<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Mendel’s law of dominance states that in a heterozygote, one trait will conceal the presence of another trait for the same characteristic. Rather than both alleles contributing to a phenotype, the dominant allele will be expressed exclusively.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Dominant-An allele whose trait always shows up in the organism when it is present.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An individual with one dominant and one recessive allele for a gene will have the dominant phenotype. They are generally considered “carriers” of the recessive allele: the recessive allele is there, but the recessive phenotype is not.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In the case of a dominant trait, only one copy of the dominant allele is required to express the trait. The effect of the other allele (the recessive allele) is masked by the dominant allele. Typically, an individual who carries two copies of a dominant allele exhibits the same trait as those who carry only one copy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Dominant refers to the relationship between two versions of a gene. Individuals receive two versions of each gene, known as alleles, from each parent. If the alleles of a gene are different, one allele will be expressed; it is the dominant gene. The effect of the other allele, called recessive, is masked.
