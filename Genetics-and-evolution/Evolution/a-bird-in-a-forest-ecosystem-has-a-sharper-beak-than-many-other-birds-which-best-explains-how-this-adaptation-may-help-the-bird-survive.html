<strong> A bird in a forest ecosystem has a sharper beak than many other birds. Which best explains how this adaptation may help the bird survive? 
</strong>
<p>(A) It enables the bird to dig for water. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** It increases the likelihood for the bird to obtain food. 
</p>
<p>(C) It increases the likelihood of the bird finding a suitable mate. 
</p>
