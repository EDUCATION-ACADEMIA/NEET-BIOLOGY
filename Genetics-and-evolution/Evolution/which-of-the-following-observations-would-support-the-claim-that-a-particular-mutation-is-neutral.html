<strong> Which of the following observations would support the claim that a particular mutation is neutral? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The frequency of the mutation in a population, once it first appears, tends to increase over time. 
</p>
<p>(B) In a given population, individuals that possess this mutation have a greater rate of reproduction. 
</p>
<p>(C) The mutation is higher in populations of organisms that produce fewer offspring and have shorter life spans. 
</p>
<p>(D) ** The frequency of the mutation goes up and down with no observable effect on the health of a population.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Which of the following observations would support the claim that a particular mutation is neutral? The frequency of the mutation goes up and down with no observable effect on the health of a population.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In population genetics, mutations in which natural selection does not affect the spread of the mutation in a species are termed neutral mutations. Neutral mutations that are inheritable and not linked to any genes under selection will be lost or will replace all other alleles of the gene.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Mutational effects can be beneficial, harmful, or neutral, depending on their context or location. Most non-neutral mutations are deleterious. In general, the more base pairs that are affected by a mutation, the larger the effect of the mutation, and the larger the mutationâ€™s probability of being deleterious.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The majority of mutations have neither negative nor positive effects on the organism in which they occur. These mutations are called neutral mutations. Examples include silent point mutations. They are neutral because they do not change the a mino acid s in the proteins they encode.
