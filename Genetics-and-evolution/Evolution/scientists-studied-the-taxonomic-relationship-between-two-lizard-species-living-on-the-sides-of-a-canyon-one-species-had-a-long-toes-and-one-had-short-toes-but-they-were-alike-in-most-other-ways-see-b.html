<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-One species had long toes and one had short toes, but they were alike in most other ways. The table shows what the scientists found. What is the MOST likely reason for these finds? Short-toed lizards evolved from long-toed lizards on the shady side of the canyon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Organisms can be classified according to any number of criteria, including overall similarities, colors, ecological functions, etc. However, it is generally agreed that the most useful way for scientists to organize biological diversity is to group organisms according to shared evolutionary history.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Fossils provide evidence of long-term evolutionary changes, documenting the past existence of species that are now extinct.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Evidence that land vertebrates descended from fish includes transitional fossils, anatomical similarities among embryos and adult animals, and genetic evidence of common ancestry.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and their extinct ancestors form a family of organisms known as the Hominidae. Researchers generally agree that among the living animals in this group, humans are most closely related to chimpanzees, judging from comparisons of anatomy and genetics.
