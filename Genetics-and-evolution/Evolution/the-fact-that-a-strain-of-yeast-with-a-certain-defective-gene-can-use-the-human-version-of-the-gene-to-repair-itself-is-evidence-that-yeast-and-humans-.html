<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Paul Nurse demonstrated that a strain of yeast with a defective gene could use the human version of that gene to repair itself. That we not only share a common genetic code with other organisms, but that we actually share specific genes, is powerful evidence of our common ancestry.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Some yeast genes can be replaced by human genes that then continue to produce the same human proteins in the yeast cells. Which statement helps to explain this evidence? The genetic code is universal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Yeast possesses 23% homologous genes to humans; therefore, it is considered as a useful model for gene function studies (2). Although yeast and human diverged from a common ancestor Â 1 billion years ago, lines of evidence demonstrate the strong conservation of gene function between yeast and humans (3).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-(A) The wild type (wt) human genes associated with a disease, with an essential yeast ortholog/paralog, have been expressed in yeast temperature sensitivity (ts) mutant strains and grown at restrictive temperature to test their ability to rescue the ts phenotype.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The gene that indicates a common ancestral relationship between humans and yeasts is the myosin gene. This gene is responsible for coding myosin which is an important protein found in the muscles.
