<strong> Darwin noticed that finches on different islands had uniquely shaped beaks. Which of the following best describes why he felt this had occurred? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The finches were dying off rapidly, creating a wide variety in characteristics 
</p>
<p>(B) The finches were competing against each other, creating shifts in the gene frequencies 
</p>
<p>(C) ** The finches had adapted to the different food source in their habitats, leading to a shift in the gene frequencies 
</p>
<p>(D) The finches were impacted by different diseases in their different environments

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-1: Darwin’s Finches: Darwin observed that beak shape varies among finch species. He postulated that the beak of an ancestral species had adapted over time to equip the finches to acquire different food sources.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-He noticed that each finch species had a different type of beak, depending on the food available on its island. The finches that ate large nuts had strong beaks for breaking the nuts open. Finches that ate small nuts and seeds had beaks for cracking nuts and seeds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In particular, changes to the size and shape of the beaks have enabled the different species to specialise in different types of food: seeds, insects, cactus flowers and fruits or even bird blood. The Galápagos finches are a classic example of adaptive radiation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Different beaks in the finches depict the availability of different foods on the islands and show that they evolved from a common ancestor. Some ground finches have small beaks that survive on soft and small seeds.
