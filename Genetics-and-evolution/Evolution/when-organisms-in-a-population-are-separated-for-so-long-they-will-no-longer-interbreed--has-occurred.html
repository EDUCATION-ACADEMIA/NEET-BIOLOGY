<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Allopatric speciation (1) occurs when a species separates into two separate groups which are isolated from one another. A physical barrier, such as a mountain range or a waterway, makes it impossible for them to breed with one another.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Speciation is the event that occurs when two populations of a particular species can no longer interbreed. Speciation is not defined by physical barriers or by the time that two populations are separate from one another.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-New species arise through a process called speciation. In speciation, an ancestral species splits into two or more descendant species that are genetically different from one another and can no longer interbreed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The central idea here is that when populations are geographically separated, they will diverge from one another, both in the way they look and genetically. These changes might occur by natural selection or by random chance (i.e., genetic drift), and in both cases result in reproductive isolation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Sympatric speciation refers to a speciation process when two groups of identical species lived in identical geographical areas, they evolve in such a way that they could no longer interbreed. At that point, they are considered to be different species.
