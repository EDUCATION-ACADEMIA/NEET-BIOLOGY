<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Radiometric dating, which relies on the predictable decay of radioactive isotopes of carbon, uranium, potassium, and other elements, provides accurate age estimates for events back to the formation of Earth more than 4.5 billion years ago.
</p>

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The universe grew and cooled and eventually stars and galaxies formed. The Earth was formed about 4.6 billion years ago, that’s 4, 600, 000, 000 years ago. It was formed by collisions of particles in a large cloud of material. Slowly gravity gathered together all these particles of dust and gas and formed larger clumps.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Earth is estimated to be 4.54 billion years old, plus or minus about 50 million years. Scientists have scoured the Earth searching for the oldest rocks to radiometrically date. In northwestern Canada, they discovered rocks about 4.03 billion years old.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-An age of 4.55 ± 0.07 billion years, very close to today’s accepted age, was determined by Clair Cameron Patterson using uranium–lead isotope dating (specifically lead–lead dating) on several meteorites including the Canyon Diablo meteorite and published in 1956.
