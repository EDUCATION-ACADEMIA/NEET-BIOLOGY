<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Natural selection is the process through which populations of living organisms adapt and change. Individuals in a population are naturally variable, meaning that they are all different in some ways. This variation means that some individuals have traits better suited to the environment than others.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Natural selection is a mechanism of evolution. Organisms that are more adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and pass on the genes that aided their success. This process causes species to change and diverge over time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Survival of the fittest: A term that refers to the survival of only those organisms best able (fittest) to obtain and utilize resources, resulting in the evolution of organisms that are best adapted to the environment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Fitness = reproductive success Fitness is a measure of how well organisms survive and reproduce, with emphasis on “reproduce.” Officially, fitness is defined as the number of offspring that organisms with a particular genotype or phenotype leave behind, on average, as compared to others in the population.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-survival of the fittest, term made famous in the fifth edition (published in 1869) of On the Origin of Species by British naturalist Charles Darwin, which suggested that organisms best adjusted to their environment are the most successful in surviving and reproducing.
