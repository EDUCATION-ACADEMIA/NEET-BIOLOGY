This may involve changing a single base pair (A-T or C-G), deleting a region of DNA or adding a new segment of DNA.Genetic modification Often GM involves isolating and removing the DNA encoding a single gene from one organism, manipulating it outside the cell (in a laboratory) and reinserting it into the same organism or into the genetic material of another organism.Genetic engineering is also called genetic modification or GM. It involves modifying the genome of an organism by identifying and removing a gene from the genome of one organism, and introducing it into the genome of another organism to result in a desired characteristic.Genetic engineering is the modification of an organisms phenotype by manipulating its genetic material.
