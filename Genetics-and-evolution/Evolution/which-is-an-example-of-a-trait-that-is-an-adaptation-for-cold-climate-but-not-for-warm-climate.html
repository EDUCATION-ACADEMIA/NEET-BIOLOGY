<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Polar bears are a good example of this phenomenon. They have large, compact bodies with relatively small surface areas from which they can lose their internally produced heat. This is an important asset in cold climates. In addition, they have heavy fur and fat insulation that help retain body heat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-According to the National Park Service, there are three major strategies for animals, as well as insects and plants, to survive through cold temperatures: migration, hibernation and resistance (tolerance).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Animals have many adaptations to survive in this harsh environment; Animals need shelter and insulation in the Tundra. The animals here tend to have thicker and warmer feathers and fur. Many of them have larger bodies and shorter arms, legs and tails which helps them retain their heat better and prevent heat loss.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-1: Arctic Fox With it’s stunning white winter coat the Arctic fox is extremely well equipped to handle freezing conditions. It’s thick coat provides insulation. The hair on the pads of their feet stops them from slipping on the ice. They can curl their thick bushy tails around their nose and face to keep them warm.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Final answer: Polar bears are able to adapt to living in such a cold temperature due to the presence of white fur, fat beneath the skin, and a keen sense of smell.
