<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-These changes in relative allele frequency, called genetic drift, can either increase or decrease by chance over time. Typically, genetic drift occurs in small populations, where infrequently-occurring alleles face a greater chance of being lost.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Genetic drift is change in allele frequencies in a population from generation to generation that occurs due to chance events.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In genetic terms, evolution is the change in the relative frequency of alleles in a population.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Genetic drift is the change in allele frequencies in a population over time due to random sampling events (e.g., differences among individuals in survival or fecundity that are unrelated to their phenotype/genotype).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-gene flow, also called gene migration, the introduction of genetic material (by interbreeding) from one population of a species to another, thereby changing the composition of the gene pool of the receiving population.
