<p>(D) ** The climate changed and the dinosaurs could not adapt.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-For many years, climate change was the most credible explanation for the dinosaurs’ demise. Dinosaurs thrived in the planet’s consistently humid, tropical climate. But in the late Mesozoic Era that corresponds with the extinction of the dinosaurs, evidence shows that the planet slowly became cooler.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-This hypothesis proposes that an asteroid about 10 kilometers in diameter struck what is now the Yucatán peninsula in Mexico roughly 65 million years ago. It suggests that this impact was the primary cause of the K-Pg mass extinction event that killed the dinosaurs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The Alvarez hypothesis was initially controversial, but it is now the most widely accepted theory for the mass extinction at the end of the Mesozoic Era. Paul says, ‘An asteroid impact is supported by really good evidence because we’ve identified the crater.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The impact hypothesis states that an asteroid hit Earth sending a cloud of dust and debris into the stratosphere, blocking out the sun, stalling photosynthesis and killing plants. This would have resulted in the collapse of the global food chain causing extinction in some, but not all species.
