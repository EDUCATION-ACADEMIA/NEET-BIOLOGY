<strong> What evidence supports the theory that continents were once a large landmass? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The continents share a similar climate. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** Similar fossils have been found on different continents. 
</p>
<p>(C) Minerals like gold and copper are found worldwide. 
</p>
<p>(D) Coconut trees are found on coastlines.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Much of it is geological, such as observing matching shorelines on different continents and the occurrence of similar rocks and fossils in widely separated areas. Some of the other evidence includes how Earth’s magnetic fields have changed over time and how the continents seem to fit together like a puzzle.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Fossil Evidence One type of evidence that strongly supported the Theory of Continental Drift is the fossil record. Scientists have found fossils of similar types of plants and animals in rocks of similar age. These rocks were on the shores of different continents. This suggests that the continents were once joined.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The four pieces of evidence for the continental drift include continents fitting together like a puzzle, scattering ancient fossils, rocks, mountain ranges, and the old climatic zones’ locations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Fossils of similar organisms across widely disparate continents encouraged the revolutionary theory of continental drift. Continental drift describes one of the earliest ways geologists thought continents moved over time. Today, the theory of continental drift has been replaced by the science of plate tectonics.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The rock formations of eastern North America, Western Europe, and northwestern Africa were later found to have a common origin, and they overlapped in time with the presence of Gondwanaland. Together, these discoveries supported the existence of Pangea.
