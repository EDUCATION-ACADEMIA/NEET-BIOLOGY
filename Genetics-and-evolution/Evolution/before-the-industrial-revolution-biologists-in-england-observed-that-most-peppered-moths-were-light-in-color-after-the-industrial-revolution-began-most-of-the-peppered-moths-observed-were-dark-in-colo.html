<strong> Before the industrial revolution, biologists in England observed that most peppered moths were light in color. After the industrial revolution began, most of the peppered moths observed were dark in color. Which statement best explains the observed change in moth color during the industrial revolution? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Light-color moths were more fit for survival because they were less camouflaged against the darkened, soot-covered tree bark 
</p>
<p>(B) Dark-color moths were more fit for survival because they were less camouflaged against the darkened, soot-covered tree bark. 
</p>
<p>(C) Light-color moths were more fit for survival because they were more camouflaged against the darkened, soot-covered tree bark. 
</p>
<p>(D) ** Dark-color moths were more fit for survival because they were more camouflaged against the darkened, soot-covered tree bark.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-During the early 19th century in Britain, the moths used to have salt-and-pepper coloring. But over the years black versions of the moth began to prevail. These days, the dark variants are the most common, and geneticists have long speculated that the Industrial Revolution is to blame.
