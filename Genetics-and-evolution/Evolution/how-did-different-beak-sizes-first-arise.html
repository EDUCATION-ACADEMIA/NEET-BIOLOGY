<strong> How did different beak sizes first arise? 
</strong>
<p>(A) They arose because of their need to be able to eat different food. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** The arose by chance (random mutation). 
</p>
<p>(C) The environment made the change happen. 
</p>
<p>(D) The finches beaks changed a little at a time each generation.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-How did different beak sizes first arise? They arose because of their need to be able to eat different food.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-How did the different beak types first arise in the Galapagos finches? a) The changes in the finches’ beak size and shape occurred because of their need to be able to eat different kinds of food to survive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Then, natural selection would probably favor different varieties in the different islands.” In other words, beaks changed as the birds developed different tastes for fruits, seeds, or insects picked from the ground or cacti. Long, pointed beaks made some of them more fit for picking seeds out of cactus fruits.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-On the Galápagos, finches evolved based on different food sources-long, pointed beaks served well for snatching insects while broad, blunt beaks work best for cracking seeds and nuts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Changes in the size and form of the beak have enabled different species to utilize different food resources such as insects, seeds, nectar from cactus flowers as well as blood from iguanas, all driven by Darwinian selection.
