<strong> The finches on the Galapagos island were similar in form except for variations of their beaks. Darwin observed that these variations were useful for: 
</strong>
<p>(A) attracting a mate 
</p>
<p>(B) defending territory 
</p>
<p>(C) building nests

<p>(D) ** gathering food

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-This variation helped Darwin arrive at his understanding that the finches and other birds had adapted to the islands and specific environments where they live, leading to the theory that species are not fixed and unchanging; instead, they evolve over time from common ancestors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-On the Galápagos, finches evolved based on different food sources-long, pointed beaks served well for snatching insects while broad, blunt beaks work best for cracking seeds and nuts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-How are finches on the Galapagos Islands similar? How are they different? The finches are similar because they all are only found in the Galapagos. They are different because they have unique diets and beak shapes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Long, pointed beaks made some of them more fit for picking seeds out of cactus fruits. Shorter, stouter beaks served best for eating seeds found on the ground. Eventually, the immigrants evolved into 14 separate species, each with its own song, food preferences, and beak shapes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The birds on different islands had many similarities, but their beaks differed in size and shape. Four of Darwin’s finch species from the Galápagos Islands. The birds came from the same finch ancestor. They evolved as they adapted to different food resources on different islands.
