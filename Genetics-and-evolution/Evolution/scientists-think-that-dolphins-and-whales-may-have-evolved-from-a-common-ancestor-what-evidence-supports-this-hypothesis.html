<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Q. Scientists think that dolphins and whales may have evolved from a common ancestor. What evidence supports this hypothesis? They swim the same way.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Looking at a whale’s body and biology, there are plenty of clues that their ancestors lived on land. They breathe air and nurse their young with their own milk, they also have paddle-shaped flippers which encase hand bones with five ‘fingers’. As embryos, whales have tiny back limbs which disappear before birth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Why are whales mammals and not fish? What are the characteristics of mammals? Answer 2: Whales are mammals because they give birth to live young, they have fur (although it is very sparse on their body), they have lungs and breath air and they provide milk for their young.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A 24-million-year-old fossil of a giant tusked dolphin lacks several features common to modern dolphins and baleen whales. The discovery shows that the common ancestor of dolphins and whales lacked these features, meaning the same adaptations for swimming must have evolved independently in both lineages.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Multiple types of evidence support the theory of evolution: Homologous structures provide evidence for common ancestry, while analogous structures show that similar selective pressures can produce similar adaptations (beneficial features).
