<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Genes are segments of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that contain the code for a specific protein that functions in one or more types of cells in the body. Chromosomes are structures within cells that contain a person’s genes. Genes are contained in chromosomes, which are in the cell nucleus.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-DNA and histone proteins are packaged into structures called chromosomes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Most DNA is located in the cell nucleus (where it is called nuclear DNA), but a small amount of DNA can also be found in the mitochondria (where it is called mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Genetic information is carried in the linear sequence of nucleotides in DNA. Each molecule of DNA is a double helix formed from two complementary strands of nucleotides held together by hydrogen bonds between G-C and A-T base pairs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Eukaryotic chromosomes are found in the cell’s nucleus. The DNA inside the nucleus is organized into chromosomes. At the most basic level, a chromosome is a molecule of DNA that is tightly coiled around proteins called histones. Eukaryotic cells have multiple chromosomes that are linear in shape.
