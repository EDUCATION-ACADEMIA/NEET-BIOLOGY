<strong> Which statement best explains why dark colored peppered moths survived once the trees turned black due to industrial pollution? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Other insects were no longer in competition with the dark colored moths. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** The dark moths were better adapted to the changing environment and were able to evade predators and pass their genes on. 
</p>
<p>(C) The darker moths were more adapted to attack predators.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Hence, the correct answer is an option (C). Natural selection in a smoky environment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Genetic Changes Moths passed their color to the next generation. Eggs from light moths developed into light moths and dark moth eggs turned to dark adults. The dark color was caused by a mutation in the DNA of a single moth, and the mutated gene had been passed to all its offspring.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-As the trees darkened with soot, the light-colored moths were easier to see. They were eaten by birds more and more, while the rare dark colored moths blended in better on the darker trees. This made the dark colored moths have a higher survival rate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Scientists have discovered the specific mutation that famously turned moths black during the Industrial Revolution. In an iconic evolutionary case study, a black form of the peppered moth rapidly took over in industrial parts of the UK during the 1800s, as soot blackened the tree trunks and walls of its habitat.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Rather than cause the black color mutation, the sooty conditions of the Industrial Revolution created the perfect backdrop for black moths to survive. As soot covered surfaces throughout Britain, black moths blended in with their background, escaping notice by predators and thriving.
