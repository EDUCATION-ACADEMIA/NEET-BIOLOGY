<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Because they could access food, the giraffes with longer necks were better able to survive and reproduce, with their offspring inheriting their long necks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-It appears obvious: the giraffe’s neck, which can grow to as much as two metres in length, has been selected because it gives its owner exclusive access to the topmost leaves of the trees, and no other animal can reach them. This, then, is an adaptation designed to avoid competition for food with other animals.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The competition between males, which they stated had longer and stronger necks, had driven the evolution of the giraffe neck, with female giraffes somehow carried along as sexual selection among males kept pushing the limits of neck length.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Since these shorter creatures pick over food at a lower level, giraffes’ necks allow them to reach food and nutrients that others cannot. This becomes especially important for survival in habitats where food can become scarce and droughts are fairly common.
