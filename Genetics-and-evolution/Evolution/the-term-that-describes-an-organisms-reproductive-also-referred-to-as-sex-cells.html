Gametes are haploid cells, and each cell carries only one copy of each chromosome.These sex cells are also called reproductive cells or gametes. Sperm cells are produced in mens testicles and egg cells are produced in womens ovaries. Sex cells are different from other cells in one special way: Put simply, they only have one half of the total amount of human genetic information.Sexual reproduction Each parent contributes a gamete-a sex cell that has half of the normal DNA of a regular body cell. In males, the gametes are sperm and in females, the gametes are eggs. When these two gamete combine during fertilization, the result is a zygote, which then continues to develop into an embryo.Both males and female gametes are formed by a process known as gametogenesis in their respective reproductive organs. During the process of gametogenesis, a diploid (2n) cell undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid (n) cells.Also referred to as sex cells, gametes are reproductive cells of an entity.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Gametes are an organism’s reproductive cells. They are also referred to as sex cells. Female gametes are called ova or egg cells, and male gametes are called sperm. Gametes are haploid cells, and each cell carries only one copy of each chromosome.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-These sex cells are also called reproductive cells or gametes. Sperm cells are produced in men’s testicles and egg cells are produced in women’s ovaries. Sex cells are different from other cells in one special way: Put simply, they only have one half of the total amount of human genetic information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Sexual reproduction Each parent contributes a gamete-a sex cell that has half of the normal DNA of a regular body cell. In males, the gametes are sperm and in females, the gametes are eggs. When these two gamete combine during fertilization, the result is a zygote, which then continues to develop into an embryo.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Both males and female gametes are formed by a process known as “gametogenesis” in their respective reproductive organs. During the process of gametogenesis, a diploid (2n) cell undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid (n) cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Also referred to as sex cells, gametes are reproductive cells of an entity. These are haploid cells wherein each of it carries one copy of chromosome. Male gametes are known as sperms while female gametes are known as ova or eggs. The reproductive cells are an outcome of the process of meiosis.
