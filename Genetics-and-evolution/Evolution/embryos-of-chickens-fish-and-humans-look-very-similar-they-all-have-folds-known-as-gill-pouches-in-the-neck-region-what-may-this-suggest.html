<strong> Embryos of chickens, fish and humans look very similar. They all have folds known as gill pouches in the neck region. What may this suggest? 
</strong>
<p>(A) they all formed in the ocean 
</p>
<p>(B) ** they all evolved from a common ancestor 
</p>
<p>(C) they are all going extinct

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-They all have folds called gill pouches in the neck region. In fish, these folds develop into gills. Although adult chickens and humans do not have gills, the similarities in their embryos suggest that these organisms are at least distantly related.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Comparative embryology is the study of the similarities and differences in the embryos of different species. Similarities in embryos are evidence of common ancestry. All vertebrate embryos, for example, have gill slits and tails. Most vertebrates, except for fish, lose their gill slits by adulthood.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Similar structures are present in the embryos of fish, chickens, and rabbits. In fish, these structures develop into gills, but in chickens and rabbits, they either disappear or develop into other body parts later in embryonic development. The three species have a common ancestor with these embryonic structures.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-For example, fish embryos and human embryos both have gill slits. In fish they develop into gills, but in humans they disappear before birth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In the embryos of all vertebrates, the presence of gill slits supports the theory of recapitulation (repeating the early stages of embryogenesis in earlier evolved animals.)

<p>Why are the embryos of the vertebrates such as fish rabbit and human so similar morphologically? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 12 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What is the study of comparing embryos of different species to look for similarities and differences? 
</p>

</strong>
</p>
<p>What type of evidence is described in the below statement fish bird rabbit and human embryos all have gill slits and tails? 
</p>
<p>
