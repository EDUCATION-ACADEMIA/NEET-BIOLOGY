<strong> Which of the following is required for a trait to become more common over time in a population? 
</strong>
<p>(A) There must be many varieties of the trait in the population. 
</p>
<p>(B) The trait must allow members of the population to eat only some kinds of food. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** The trait must give individuals an advantage in producing offspring that survive. 
</p>
<p>(D) The trait must be the result of an immediate change in the environment. 
</p>
<p>
<div style ="text-align:center">
<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-If a trait results in more offspring who share the trait, then that trait is more likely to become common in the population than a trait that arises randomly. At the molecular level, selection occurs when a particular DNA variant becomes more common because of its effect on the organisms that carry it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Organisms with heritable (genetically determined) features that help them survive and reproduce in a particular environment tend to leave more offspring than their peers. If this continues over generations, the heritable features that aid survival and reproduction will become more and more common in the population.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An adaptation is any heritable trait that helps an organism, such as a plant or animal, survive and reproduce in its environment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Evolution is defined as the change in the inherited traits of a population of organisms through successive generations. When living organisms reproduce, they pass on to their progeny a collection of traits.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Natural selection is a non-random difference in reproductive output among replicating entities, often due indirectly to differences in survival in a particular environment, leading to an increase in the proportion of beneficial, heritable characteristics within a population from one generation to the next.
