<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A geologist hiking through the woods in Ohio finds rocks containing fossils in a stream bank. The fossils look similar to animals currently living in the ocean. Which conclusion should the geologist make based on the discovery of these fossils? Animals that live in the stream today lived in the ocean long ago.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Fossils are the remains of plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, and single-celled living things that have been replaced by rock material or impressions of organisms preserved in rock. Paleontologists use fossil remains to understand different aspects of extinct and living organisms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Fossils provide important evidence for evolution and the adaptation of plants and animals to their environments. Fossil evidence provides a record of how creatures evolved and how this process can be represented by a ‘tree of life’, showing that all species are related to each other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Impression fossils form when the organisms original bone or tissue is removed by processes that occur after burial, such as ground water flow. If the organisms remains are decomposed entirely, leaving an empty space in the shape of the organism, it is referred to as a cast.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-How can fossils tell us about Earth’s past? Fossils give clues about environmental changes where the organism lived. Fossils can be used to date the time period of rocks and rock layers when the organism lived. Fossils can give clues of changes in the organism’s body structure over time.
