<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Natural selection, also known as “survival of the fittest, ” is the more prolific reproduction of individuals with favorable traits that survive environmental change because of those traits. This leads to evolutionary change, the trait becoming predominant within a population.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-the phrase “survival of the fittest” as an exact equivalent of. “natural selection.” He said: The survival of the fittest which I have here sought to, express in. mechanical terms is that which Mr. Darwin has called “natural selec-tion, ” or the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An adaptation is any heritable trait that helps an organism, such as a plant or animal, survive and reproduce in its environment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The theory of natural selection was explored by 19th-century naturalist Charles Darwin. Natural selection explains how genetic traits of a species may change over time. This may lead to speciation, the formation of a distinct new species.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The Principles of Biology by Herbert Spencer (1864) looked at biology in terms of themes, such as Function, Adaptation and Variation. In this book Spencer introduced the expression ‘survival of the fittest’, in the sense of ‘the most appropriate to its environment’.
