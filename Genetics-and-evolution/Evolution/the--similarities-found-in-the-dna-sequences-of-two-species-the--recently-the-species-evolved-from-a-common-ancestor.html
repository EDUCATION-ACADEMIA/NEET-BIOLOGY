<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-That’s because closely related species most likely diverged from one another fairly recently in the evolutionary span. Thus, they haven’t had as much time to accumulate random mutations in their genetic codes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Evolutionarily Related Gene Sequences Homologous genes can be generated by speciation, which produces pairs of orthologs (genes in different species that are derived from the same gene in the last common ancestral species, and thus usually have similar functions).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The pattern of branching in a phylogenetic tree reflects how species or other groups evolved from a series of common ancestors. In trees, two species are more related if they have a more recent common ancestor and less related if they have a less recent common ancestor.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-common ancestor: The most recent ancestral form or species from which two different species evolved. comparative biology: The study of patterns among more than one species.

</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 2 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What could cause similarity in the DNA sequences between two species? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 3 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Are two species more related if they have a more recent common ancestor and less related if they have a less recent common? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 4 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What is the most recent ancestral form of species from which two different species evolved?

</strong>
</p>
<p>Which of the following is the rise of 2 or more species from one existing species? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 6 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What is the evolution of two or more species each adapting to changes in the other and their environment called? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 7 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>When two or more species sharing a common ancestor become more different over time resulting from adaptations to different environmental conditions? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 8 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What is it called when two species that are closely related become increasingly different? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 9 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What can determine that two different species have a relatively recent common ancestor? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 10 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>When two sequences are similar but are present in related organisms they are known as? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 11 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What does the similarity of DNA and proteins show about two species of animals? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 12 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>When DNA from two different species are joined together it is called recombinant DNA *? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 13 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>When there is an increase in similarities among species derived from different ancestors as a result of similar adaptation to similar environment? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 14 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>When two or more organisms have similarities that they inherited from a common ancestor we call these similarities ? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 15 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What is the evolution of similar forms in different lineages when exposed to the same selective pressures?
