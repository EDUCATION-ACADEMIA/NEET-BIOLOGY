<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Transitional fossils are predicted by Darwin’s theory of evolution. This theory, also known as descent with alteration, claims that all life began as a single cell and evolved into the various types of life we see today. There have been no discoveries of the transitional fossils expected by descent with an alteration.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Transitional fossils are remnants of an organism that came in between a known version of a species and the current species. Allegedly, transitional fossils would be evidence for evolution because it would show intermediate forms of a species and they changed and accumulated adaptations at a slow pace.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Transitional forms provide evidence that species descend with modification from other species. DNA from the fossils of transitional forms provides information about how ancient organisms are related.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A fossil that shows an intermediate state between an ancestral trait and that of its later descendants is said to bear a transitional feature. The fossil record includes many examples of transitional features, providing an abundance of evidence for evolutionary change over time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The transitional fossils are fossils that show intermediary links between groups of organisms. It provides a link between the past and present species. These transitional fossils are the strongest evidence of Darwin’s theory of evolution.
