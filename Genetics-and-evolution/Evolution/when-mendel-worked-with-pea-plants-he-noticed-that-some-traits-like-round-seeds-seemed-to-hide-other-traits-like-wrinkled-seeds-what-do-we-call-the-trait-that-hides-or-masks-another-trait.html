<strong> When Mendel worked with pea plants, he noticed that some traits, like round seeds, seemed to hide other traits, like wrinkled seeds. What do we call the trait that hides or masks another trait? 
</strong>
<p>(A) A recessive trait 
</p>
<p>(B) Incomplete dominance 
</p>
<p>(C) DNA replication

<p>(D) ** A dominant trait

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Mendel crossbred round seed plants with wrinkled seed plants, it was observed that in F1 progeny, only round seed plants were obtained and no wrinkled seed plant was obtained. But in the F2 generation, both round and wrinkled seed plants were obtained in a 3:1 ratio.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-As a result of crossing these two pea variants, Mendel discovered that the round-seeded and wrinkled-seeded traits were two facets of the same character, suggesting to modern plant scientists that a single gene determines whether seeds are round or wrinkled.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Understanding Dominant Traits For example, when Mendel cross-fertilized plants with wrinkled seeds to those with smooth seeds, he did not get progeny with semi-wrinkly seeds. Instead, the progeny from this cross had only smooth seeds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Dominant-Traits that appear to mask (or hide) other traits. Recessive-Traits that can be hidden in one generation and then appear in the next. Incomplete dominance-Traits in which the heterozygote shows a different phenotype from the homozygous dominant phenotype.
