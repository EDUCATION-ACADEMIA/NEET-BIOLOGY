Artificial selection is different from natural selection.Selective breeding (also called artificial selection) is the process by which humans use animal breeding and plant breeding to selectively develop particular phenotypic traits (characteristics) by choosing which typically animal or plant males and females will sexually reproduce and have offspring together.Techniques such as artificial insemination can be used to increase the selection intensity.
