<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Peter and Rosemary Grant are distinguished for their remarkable long-term studies demonstrating evolution in action in Galápagos finches. They have demonstrated how very rapid changes in body and beak size in response to changes in the food supply are driven by natural selection.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Peter and Rosemary Grant have seen evolution happen over the course of just two years. The Grants study the evolution of Darwin’s finches on the Galapagos Islands. The birds have been named for Darwin, in part, because he later theorized that the 13 distinct species were all descendants of a common ancestor.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Directional selection occurs when one of two extreme phenotypes is selected for. This shifts the distribution toward that extreme. This is the type of natural selection that the Grants observed in the beak size of Galápagos finches.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In Darwin’s finches, those that have short beaks turned out to be an adaptation that made them more suited into poking holes in the ground and feed on grubs. 3. Darwin’s finches are an example of how natural selection caused variation of beaks among finches.
