<strong> What is the most likely result if two populations of the same species are separated for a long period of time? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Neither population will change. 
</p>
<p>(B) Both populations will change in the same ways. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** The populations will change in different ways. 
</p>
<p>(D) Both populations will become extinct. 
</p>
<p>
<div style ="text-align:center">
<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-So, the correct answer is ‘The two populations will experience allopatric speciation’
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Speciation occurs when a group within a species separates from other members of its species and develops its own unique characteristics. The demands of a different environment or the characteristics of the members of the new group will differentiate the new species from their ancestors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The central idea here is that when populations are geographically separated, they will diverge from one another, both in the way they look and genetically. These changes might occur by natural selection or by random chance (i.e., genetic drift), and in both cases result in reproductive isolation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Speciation is the process by which new species form. It occurs when groups in a species become reproductively isolated and diverge. In allopatric speciation, groups from an ancestral population evolve into separate species due to a period of geographical separation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Two populations of the same species over time grow distant from one another. At what point will these two populations be considered different species? Explanation: Speciation is the event that occurs when two populations of a particular species can no longer interbreed.

<p>What may happen if two populations are competing for the same living space? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 14 :
