<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Imprints of the shells of ocean clams are often found in the rocks of the Appalachian Mountains. What do these imprint fossils MOST likely indicate? These mountains were once under the ocean.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Solution : Fossils provide solid evidence that organisms from the past are not the same as those found today. Fossils show a progression of evolution by comparing the atomical record of fossils with modern and extinct species. Paleontologist can infer the linkages of their species.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Which of the following best describes the fossil at Point 3 when compared with the fossils at Points 1 and 2? The fossil at Point 3 is older. Study the image. This image shows two layers of rock.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Which observation provides the best evidence that two different animals most likely have a common ancestor? They have similarities in early embryonic development.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Evidence that land vertebrates descended from fish includes transitional fossils, anatomical similarities among embryos and adult animals, and genetic evidence of common ancestry.
