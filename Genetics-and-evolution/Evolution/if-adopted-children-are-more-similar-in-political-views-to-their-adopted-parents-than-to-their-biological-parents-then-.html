<p>(A) random mutations may be responsible for the differences between adopted children and their adoptive parents. 
</p>
<p>(B) the genetic code determining political views probably occurs randomly. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** political views have nothing to do with your genetics.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-If adopted children are more similar in political interests to their adopted parents than to their biological parents then: a. specific genes probably predispose people to political interests.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Twin and adoption studies are two instances of a much broader class of methods for observing nature-nurture called quantitative genetics, the scientific discipline in which similarities among individuals are analyzed based on how biologically related they are.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The answer has to do with the fact that each parent actually has two different sets of genes. And that each parent passes only half of their genes to their child. And that the half that gets passed down is random. All of this together ensures that each child ends up with a different, unique set of genes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The debate between “blank-slate” denial of the influence of heritability, and the view admitting both environmental and heritable traits, has often been cast in terms of nature versus nurture.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Scientists estimate that 20 to 60 percent of temperament is determined by genetics. Temperament, however, does not have a clear pattern of inheritance and there are not specific genes that confer specific temperamental traits.
