<strong> Mendel proposed that traits observed in pea plants resulted from a combination of “factors” inherited from each parent. His description of these “factors” can be considered the first scientific definition of the role of-

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Working with garden pea plants, Mendel found that crosses between parents that differed for one trait produced F1 offspring that all expressed one parent’s traits. The traits that were visible in the F1 generation are referred to as dominant, and traits that disappear in the F1 generation are described as recessive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Mendel observed that, when peas with more than one trait were crossed, the progeny did not always match the parents. This is because different traits are inherited independently – this is the principle of independent assortment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Genetic recombination (genetic reshuffling) is the exchange of genetic material between different organisms which leads to production of offspring with combinations of traits that differ from those found in either parent.
