<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Epigenetics allows the muscle cell to turn “on” genes to make proteins important for its job and turn “off” genes important for a nerve cell’s job. Your epigenetics change throughout your life.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The process of turning genes on and off is known as gene regulation. Gene regulation is an important part of normal development.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Environmental factors, such as nutrition, stress, and teratogens are thought to change gene expression by switching genes on and off. These gene changes can then be inherited by daughter cells.
