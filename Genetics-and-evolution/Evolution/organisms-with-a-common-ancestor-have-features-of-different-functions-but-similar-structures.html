<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Homologous structures are similar physical features in organisms that share a common ancestor, but the features serve completely different functions. An example of homologous structures are the limbs of humans, cats, whales, and bats.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Homologous structures are structures that are similar in related organisms because they were inherited from a common ancestor. These structures may or may not hav e the same function in the descendants. Figure below shows the hands of several different mammals. They all have the same basic pattern of bones.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Features of animals that have similar structure are classified as homologous if they have a common evolutionary origin, even if they have different functions in different animals. A classic example of homologous structures is that of the wing of a bat and the arm of a human.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Homologous features If two or more species share a unique physical feature, such as a complex bone structure or a body plan, they may all have inherited this feature from a common ancestor. Physical features shared due to evolutionary history (a common ancestor) are said to be homologous.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Now let’s look at analogous structures. Analogous structures have different morphology, which means they are different in structure but have similar function. Let’s take our bat wing again, and this time compare it to a butterfly wing and a bird wing.
