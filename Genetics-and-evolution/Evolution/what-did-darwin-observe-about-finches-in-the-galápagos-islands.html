<title>What did Darwin observe about finches in the Galápagos Islands?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Out of the 14 finches observed by Darwin, 13 were from the Galapagos island, and one was from the Cocos island. These finches evolved from a common ancestor to have different beaks well-suited for different types of food they feed on. Usually, long and pointed beaks are more fitted for seed and cactus feeders.He noticed that each finch species had a different type of beak, depending on the food available on its island. The finches that ate large nuts had strong beaks for breaking the nuts open. Finches that ate small nuts and seeds had beaks for cracking nuts and seeds.1: Darwins Finches: Darwin observed that beak shape varies among finch species. He postulated that the beak of an ancestral species had adapted over time to equip the finches to acquire different food sources.As their name suggests, they feed mostly on Opuntia cacti. When the Opuntia are in flower, the finches feed almost exclusively on pollen and nectar. During other times of the year, they will feed on Opuntia seeds and fruit. They will also feed on a range of other vegetative foods and invertebrates.In other words, beaks changed as the birds developed different tastes for fruits, seeds, or insects picked from the ground or cacti. Long, pointed beaks made some of them more fit for picking seeds out of cactus fruits. Shorter, stouter beaks served best for eating seeds found on the ground.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
