<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The law of superposition is one of the principles of geology scientists use to determine the relative ages of rock strata, or layers. This principle states that layers of rock are superimposed, or laid down one on top of another. The oldest rock strata will be on the bottom and the youngest at the top.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Superposition. Sedimentary rocks are deposited one on top of another. Therefore, the youngest layers are found at the top, and the oldest layers are found at the bottom of the sequence.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The law of superposition is the principle that states that younger rocks lie above older rocks if the layers have not been disturbed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-law of superposition, a major principle of stratigraphy stating that within a sequence of layers of sedimentary rock, the oldest layer is at the base and that the layers are progressively younger with ascending order in the sequence.
