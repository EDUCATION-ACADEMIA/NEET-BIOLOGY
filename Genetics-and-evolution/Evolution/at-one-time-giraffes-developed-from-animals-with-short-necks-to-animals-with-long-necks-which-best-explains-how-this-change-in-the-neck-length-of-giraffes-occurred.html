<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The accepted theory on giraffe evolution is that the giraffes with the longest necks passed on their genes through natural selection, and that it took millions of years to get the animal we see now. The two forces that drove giraffes towards elongating their necks are simple. The need to eat and the need to breed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A Darwinian theory of evolution posits that it was through random variation that some giraffes had longer necks than others. Thanks to their long necks, they were able to reach leaves high up in the trees in their environment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Charles Darwin held up giraffes as a prime example of natural selection, his theory that’s often summarized as “survival of the fittest.” Giraffes with comparably longer necks could reach food high up in trees, which gave them an advantage over other animals and members of their own species with shorter necks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Since the days of Charles Darwin, the long necks of giraffes have been a textbook example of evolution. The theory goes that as giraffe ancestors competed for food, those with longer necks were able to reach higher leaves, getting a leg-or neck-up over shorter animals.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Perhaps the lofty view it affords helps the animals spot predators, or maybe its large surface area assists in regulating body temperature. It has even been suggested that the neck might have evolved in response to giraffes’ legs getting longer, so ensuring that they could continue to drink at waterholes.
