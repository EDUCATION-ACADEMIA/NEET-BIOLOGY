<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Paternity testing looks at the DNA of two people (often a father and a child) to determine how much of their DNA is the same and how much is different. If the two people share more DNA with each other than would be expected, the test will be positive: they are highly likely to be father and son.
</p>

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-DNA fingerprinting is a technique used to compare DNA sequences of any two individuals quickly. Itâ€™s used as evidence in courts, to identify bodies, track down blood relatives, and look for cures for diseases. DNA fingerprinting is extremely accurate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-DNA Fingerprinting DNA fingerprinting is a laboratory technique used to determine the probable identity of a person based on the nucleotide sequences of certain regions of human DNA that are unique to individuals.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Basically scientists use certain enzymes from bacteria to cut up two samples of DNA. These enzymes cut DNA at very specific DNA sequences. Scientists cut different DNA samples with the enzyme and look at the pattern of cuts. If the pattern of cut DNA looks different, then the two samples were different.
