<meta name="description" content="Speciation is how a new kind of plant or animal species is created. Speciation occurs when a group within a species separates from other members of its species and develops its own unique characteristics.New species form by speciation, in which an ancestral population splits into two or more genetically distinct descendant populations. Speciation involves reproductive isolation of groups within the original population and accumulation of genetic differences between the two groups.New species form in three primary ways: (1) allopatric, (2) parapatric, and (3) sympatric speciation. In the most common type of speciation, allopatric speciation, new species arise via the geographic isolation of populations (Figure 6.1).There are four geographic modes of speciation in nature, based on the extent to which speciating populations are isolated from one another: allopatric, peripatric, parapatric, and sympatric. Speciation may also be induced artificially, through animal husbandry, agriculture, or laboratory experiments.The main factors responsible for the evolution of a new species from the existing ones are natural selection, genetic drift, geographical isolation, and mutation.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Speciation is how a new kind of plant or animal species is created. Speciation occurs when a group within a species separates from other members of its species and develops its own unique characteristics.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-New species form by speciation, in which an ancestral population splits into two or more genetically distinct descendant populations. Speciation involves reproductive isolation of groups within the original population and accumulation of genetic differences between the two groups.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-There are four geographic modes of speciation in nature, based on the extent to which speciating populations are isolated from one another: allopatric, peripatric, parapatric, and sympatric. Speciation may also be induced artificially, through animal husbandry, agriculture, or laboratory experiments.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The main factors responsible for the evolution of a new species from the existing ones are natural selection, genetic drift, geographical isolation, and mutation. Reproductive isolation and environmental factors on the isolated population are also responsible for the formation of new species.
