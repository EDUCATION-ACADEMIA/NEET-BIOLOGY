<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Thanks to their long necks, they were able to reach leaves high up in the trees in their environment. Because they could access food, the giraffes with longer necks were better able to survive and reproduce, with their offspring inheriting their long necks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Giraffe’s long-neck evolution has long been attributed to foraging for sustenance in the high canopy, now researchers argue that selection for head-butting combat played a role in the long length of giraffe necks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The long neck of the giraffe has been held as a classic example of adaptive evolution since Darwin’s time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-These shorter creatures also need to eat, snacking on plants and foliage at a height that may not even reach giraffes’ knees. Since these shorter creatures pick over food at a lower level, giraffes’ necks allow them to reach food and nutrients that others cannot.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Some animals, such as giraffes, have more than one unique adaptation. A giraffe’s long neck allows it to reach food sources in the Serengeti region of Africa that other land animals cannot reach. Giraffes also have very long tongues, reaching 16-18 inches. They use their tongues as tools to pull leaves from branches.
