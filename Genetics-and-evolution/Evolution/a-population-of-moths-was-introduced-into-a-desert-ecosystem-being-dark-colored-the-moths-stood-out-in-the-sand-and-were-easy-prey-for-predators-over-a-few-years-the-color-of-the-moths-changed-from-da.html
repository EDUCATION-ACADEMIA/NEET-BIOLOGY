<strong> A population of moths was introduced into a desert ecosystem. Being dark-colored, the moths stood out in the sand and were easy prey for predators. Over a few years, the color of the moths changed from dark brown to light brown. What role does natural selection play in this example? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The change of color made their bodies tolerant to the harsh desert sand. 
</p>
<p>(B) The change of color allowed them to deflect the excessive heat. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** The change of color allowed them to hide better from predators. 
</p>
<p>(D) The change of color enabled them to regulate their body temperature.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The process is known as industrial melanism-melanism meaning the development of dark coloured pigmentation. The Liverpool-led team found that this colour change was produced by a mutation in the cortex gene, which occurred during the mid 1800s, just before the first reported sighting of black peppered moths.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The evolution of the peppered moth is an evolutionary instance of directional colour change in the moth population as a consequence of air pollution during the Industrial Revolution. The frequency of dark-coloured moths increased at that time, an example of industrial melanism.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In the absence of predators, the population of both white and dark-colored moths will become equal since there is no controlling factor for any particular colored moth. The shift from white to dark-colored moths was caused by the predation of the white-colored moths, which forced them to evolve.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-How are the peppered moths turning from light colored to dark colored an example of natural selection? Dark moths had a higher chance of survival, longer lives, and more time to reproduce so eventually there were more.
