<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Evolution: Evolution consists of changes in the heritable traits of a population of organisms as successive generations replace one another.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Evolution is a process that results in changes in the genetic material of a population over time. Evolution reflects the adaptations of organisms to their changing environments and can result in altered genes, novel traits, and new species.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Evolution is the process by which populations of organisms change over generations. Genetic variations underlie these changes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-adaptation: Any heritable characteristic of an organism that improves its ability to survive and reproduce in its environment.

<h4>Try yourself to solve below questions:
</h4>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 1 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What do we call it when over multiple generations differential success within a species can change the genetic makeup and the traits in a population? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 2 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What is the process by which populations change over time due to the changes in their environment? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 3 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What is it called when a population of organisms shows changes over many many generations? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 4 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What is a phenotype that improves an organismâ€™s chance of survival in their environment considered? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 5 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Which is an example of environment affecting the phenotype of an organism *? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 6 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Which is an example of environment affecting the phenotype of an organism group of answer choices? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 7 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>How do you call the collection of organism that belong to different population but all in the same area and interact with one another? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 8 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What do you called a population of organisms that has similar characteristics and can reproduce with one another? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 9 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What do you call it when a population becomes genetically isolated from other related groups and its allele frequencies change randomly? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 10 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What is the process of change in a population because the most beneficial trait becomes more selected in a population and helps increase survivability overall? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 11 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What is the process of change by which new species develop from pre existing species over time? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 12 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Which of the following is the process in which populations gradually change over time? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 13 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What is it called when two different populations of the same species are separated but evolve similarly anyways? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 14 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What do we call it when two or more species divide up the resources Though the evolution of new behaviors and structures like different plant roots or birds beaks? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 15 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What is it called when two species influence each other during evolution due to having close ecological interactions with each other?
