<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-So, the correct answer is ‘Individuals with the most favorable traits survive and reproduce’
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The answer choice that best describes the theory of natural selection is D) Some individuals have genes that increase their chances for survival and reproduction. These individuals are more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes, causing their genes to become more common in the next generation.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-So, the correct answer is ‘The venom of a certain salamander species becoming more poisonous as predation by snakes increases’. Was this answer helpful?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Natural selection is a mechanism of evolution. Organisms that are more adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and pass on the genes that aided their success. This process causes species to change and diverge over time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The most common of the types of natural selection is stabilizing selection. In stabilizing selection, the median phenotype is the one selected for during natural selection.
