<strong> Polar bears have a thick coat with hollow hair. How does this feature help them survive in the Arctic region? 
</strong>
<p>(A) It helps the animal store body fat. 
</p>
<p>(B) It helps the animal locate its prey. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** It traps air that keeps the animal warm. 
</p>
<p>(D) It controls water loss from the animal’s skin. 
</p>
<p>
<div style ="text-align:center">
<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-These hollow guard hairs trap warmth and bring it close to the skin to help polar bears stay warm while also providing an oily outer layer which prevents the polar bear from getting wet. The insulating hairs help polar bears stay warm by trapping heat close to the skin.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Polar bears have white fur so that they can camouflage into their environment. Their coat is so well camouflaged in Arctic environments that it can sometimes pass as a snow drift. Interestingly, the polar bear’s coat has no white pigment; in fact, a polar bear’s skin is black and its hairs are hollow.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Polar bears live in one of the planet’s coldest environments and depend on a thick coat of insulated fur, which covers a warming layer of fat. Fur even grows on the bottom of their paws, which protects against cold surfaces and provides a good grip on ice.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The Arctic is the coldest place inhabited by land mammals and these have very thick fur, which insulates the body by trapping air. They also have a layer of stored fat under the skin which gives additional insulation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The polar bear has various adaptations to live in such a freezing climate. The insulating layer of fat is present beneath the skin. Long, curved, sharp claws for walking and running on ice. A thick coat of white fur acts as protection from predators because of its white color that camouflages with the surrounding snow.
