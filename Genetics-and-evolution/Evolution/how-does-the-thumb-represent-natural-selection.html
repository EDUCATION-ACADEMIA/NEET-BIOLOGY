<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The thumb should remind you of Natural Selection. Nature votes thumbs up for adaptations that will do will in their environment, and thumbs down to adaptations that will do poorly. The genes for individuals that are not adapted for their environment will gradually be replaced by those that are better adapted.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The idea of natural selection is that traits that can be passed down allow organisms to adapt to the environment better than other organisms of the same species. This enables better survival and reproduction compared with other members of the species, leading to evolution.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Natural selection leads to adaptation, that is, to a population dominated by organisms that are anatomically, behaviorally, and physiologically well suited to survive and reproduce in a specific environment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-According to Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection, organisms that possess heritable traits that enable them to better adapt to their environment compared with other members of their species will be more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass more of their genes on to the next generation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Natural selection is the only mechanism known to cause the evolution of adaptations, so many biologists would simply define an adaptation as a char-acteristic that has evolved by natural selection.
