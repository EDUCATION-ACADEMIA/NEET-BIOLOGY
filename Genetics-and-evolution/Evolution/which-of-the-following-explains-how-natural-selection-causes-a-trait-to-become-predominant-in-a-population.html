Individuals with traits that are favorable to the environment reproduce more.So, the correct answer is Individuals with the most favorable traits survive and reproduceNatural selection explains how organisms in a population develop traits that allow them to survive and reproduce. Natural selection means that traits that offer an advantage will most likely be passed on to offspring; individuals with those traits have a better chance of surviving.Natural selection is a process by which organisms that are better adapted to specific pressures of their environment tend to survive longer and produce more offspring, thus ensuring the preservation and multiplication of those favorable traits through generations, at the expense of the less advantageous ones.">

<strong> Which of the following explains how natural selection causes a trait to become predominant in a population? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** Individuals with traits that are favorable to the environment reproduce more. 
</p>
<p>(B) Traits of an individual change in order to adapt to changes in enviornment. 
</p>
<p>(C) Organisms select which traits they wish to inherit 
</p>
<p>(D) all of these answers

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Natural selection, also known as “survival of the fittest, ” is the more prolific reproduction of individuals with favorable traits that survive environmental change because of those traits. This leads to evolutionary change, the trait becoming predominant within a population.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Q. Which of the following explains how natural selection causes a trait to become predominant in a population? Individuals with traits that are favorable to the environment reproduce more.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-So, the correct answer is ‘Individuals with the most favorable traits survive and reproduce’
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Natural selection explains how organisms in a population develop traits that allow them to survive and reproduce. Natural selection means that traits that offer an advantage will most likely be passed on to offspring; individuals with those traits have a better chance of surviving.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Natural selection is a process by which organisms that are better adapted to specific pressures of their environment tend to survive longer and produce more offspring, thus ensuring the preservation and multiplication of those favorable traits through generations, at the expense of the less advantageous ones.
