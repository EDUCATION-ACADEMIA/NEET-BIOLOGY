<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Natural selection can lead to speciation, where one species gives rise to a new and distinctly different species. It is one of the processes that drives evolution and helps to explain the diversity of life on Earth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: Evolution is a process, and natural selection is the mechanism. Evolution describes the process of a population becoming more adapted to its environment over time. Evolution occurs through the mechanism of natural selection.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Which best describes the relationship between evolution and natural selection? Natural selection leads to evolution.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Natural selection is a mechanism (differential reproductive success due to traits) Evolution is a process (change in allele frequencies over time) Natural selection is one mechanism that can lead to evolution.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-So, the correct answer is ‘Individuals with the most favorable traits survive and reproduce’
