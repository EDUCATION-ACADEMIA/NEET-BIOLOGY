<strong> In twin studies, behavior geneticists are looking for ____ 
</strong>
<p>(A) differences between fraternal twins because they are raised in the same home. 
</p>
<p>(B) whether being a twin affects emotional development and social behaviors 
</p>
<p>(C) ** similarities between identical twins because they share the same genetic code. 
</p>
<p>(D) how many times identical and fraternal twins occur in different cultures 
</p>
<p>
<div style ="text-align:center">
<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Because identical twins share all of their genes, their measurements of IQ and sleep time will be more similar the bigger role genes play in it (i.e., differences between two identical twins must be caused by the environment because their genes are the same).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Identical twins share the same genomes and are always of the same sex. In contrast, fraternal (dizygotic) twins result from the fertilization of two separate eggs with two different sperm during the same pregnancy. They share half of their genomes, just like any other siblings.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Twin studies allow disentanglement of the shared genetic and environmental factors for the trait of interest. Researchers can estimate the proportion of variance in a trait attributable to genetic variation versus the proportion that is due to shared environment or unshared environment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Because identical twins develop from a single fertilized egg, they have the same genome. So any differences between twins are due to their environments, not genetics.

<p>Why are psychologists interested in studying identical twins that have been raised in different environments? 
</p>
<p>

<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 11 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What is the study of specific genes and teams of genes that influence behavior called? 
</p>
<p>
