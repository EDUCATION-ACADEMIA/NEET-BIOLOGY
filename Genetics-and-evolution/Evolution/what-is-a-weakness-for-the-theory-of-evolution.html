<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Evolutionary theory is invalid because it is incomplete and cannot give a total explanation for the biodiversity we see around us. Gaps in the fossil record disprove evolution.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Two weaknesses are the difficulty of confirming facts because of how slow evolution can occur in some cases, as well as not necessarily explaining the mechanisms of organisms as much as alternative theories, because evolutionary theories often focus instead on larger issues instead of the precise mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The fossil record certainly has gaps, mostly because the conditions required to create fossils have been rare ever since life began on Earth. A very small percentage of animals that have lived and died ever became fossils. Thus, many pieces of the puzzle are missing; some will never be found.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-There are three varieties of gaps commonly found in the fossil record. Real gaps are those which cannot be filled. They may result from non-deposition, non-preservation, metamorphism or erosion. The other varieties of gaps are both artificial.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-First, an organism had to be suddenly buried alive underground in order for the fossil to form. If an organism had already died before being buried, it would be partially decomposed. Next, after millions of years in the ground, the fossil has to be found, which can be very unlikely.
