<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The “Griffith’s Experiment, ” conducted in 1928 by English bacteriologist Frederick Griffith described the conversion of a non-pathogenic pneumococcal bacteria to a virulent strain. In this experiment, Griffith mixed the living non-virulent bacteria with a heat inactivated virulent form.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The experiments of Griffith and Avery, MacLeod and McCarty are closely related. Griffith developed the concept of the transforming principle. The prinicple was able to transform a non-pathogenic bacteria into a pathogenic strain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In the 1920s, Frederick Griffith made an important discovery. He was studying two different strains of a bacterium, called R (rough) strain and S (smooth) strain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Griffith conducted his experiments with Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacterium that causes pneumonia. Griffith worked with two strains of this bacterium called rough (R) and smooth (S).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Griffith concluded that the R-strain bacteria must have taken up what he called a “transforming principle” from the heat-killed S bacteria, which allowed them to “transform” into smooth-coated bacteria and become virulent.
