<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Chargaff’s realization that A = T and C = G, combined with some crucially important X-ray crystallography work by English researchers Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, contributed to Watson and Crick’s derivation of the three-dimensional, double-helical model for the structure of DNA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: Watson and Crick are famous scientists who created a milestone by determining the structure of DNA. They used X-ray crystallography to identify that DNA is made up of two strands wrapped around each other to produce a double-helical structure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Which statement best describes how Watson and Crick’s model used other scientists’ work to create a model of DNA? They used Chargaff’s rule to determine that it contains ribose sugar.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Watson and Crick took a crucial conceptual step, suggesting the molecule was made of two chains of nucleotides, each in a helix as Franklin had found, but one going up and the other going down. Crick had just learned of Chargaff’s findings about base pairs in the summer of 1952.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-It was only in 1953 that James Watson and Francis Crick, based on the X-ray diffraction data produced by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, proposed a very simple but famous Double Helix model for the structure of DNA.
