<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty showed that DNA (not proteins) can transform the properties of cells, clarifying the chemical nature of genes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In a very simple experiment, Oswald Avery’s group showed that DNA was the “transforming principle.” When isolated from one strain of bacteria, DNA was able to transform another strain and confer characteristics onto that second strain. DNA was carrying hereditary information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-However, the most definitive proof that the transforming principle was DNA was its sensitivity to specific enzymes, called DNAses, that specifically degrade different kinds of DNA. Avery and his colleagues were able to show that transforming activity was not destroyed by enzymes that degrade proteins or RNA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The idea of a nonheritable exchange of genetic information was first documented in 1928 with work on the pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae (Griffith, 1928). Griffith showed that virulence factors from a killed pathogenic strain could “transform” a nonvirulent strain to become virulent as well.
