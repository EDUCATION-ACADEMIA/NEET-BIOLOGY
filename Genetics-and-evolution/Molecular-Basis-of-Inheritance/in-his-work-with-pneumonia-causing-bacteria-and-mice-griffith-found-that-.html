<strong> In his work with pneumonia-causing bacteria and mice, Griffith found that ____ 
</strong>
<p>(A) the protein coat from pathogenic cells was able to transform nonpathogenic cells. 
</p>
<p>(B) heat-killed pathogenic cells caused pneumonia. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** some substance from pathogenic cells was transferred to nonpathogenic cells, making them pathogenic.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-So, the correct option is ‘some heat-stable chemical from S cells was transferred to R cells to transform them into S cells’.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In his work with pneumonia-causing bacteria and mice, Griffith found that a. the protein coat from pathogenic cells was able to transform nonpathogenic cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-To find out, Griffith ran a series of experiments. First, Griffith took a culture of the S strain, heated the cells to kill them, and then injected the heat-killed bacteria into laboratory mice. The mice survived, suggesting that the cause of pneumonia was not a toxin from these disease-causing bacteria.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Experiment 4: Griffith mixed his heat-killed, disease-causing bacteria with live, harmless bacteria and injected the mixture into the mice. The mice developed pneumonia and died. Griffith concluded that the heat-killed bacteria passed their disease-causing ability to the harmless strain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Experiment: Griffith injected both S and R strains to mice. The one which was infected with the S strain developed pneumonia and died while that infected with the R strain stayed alive. In the second stage, Griffith heat-killed the S strain bacteria and injected into mice, but the mice stayed alive.
