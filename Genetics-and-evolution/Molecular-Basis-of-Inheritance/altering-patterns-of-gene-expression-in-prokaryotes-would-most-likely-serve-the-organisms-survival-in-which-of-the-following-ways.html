<strong> Altering patterns of gene expression in prokaryotes would most likely serve the organism’s survival in which of the following ways? 
</strong>
<p>(A) allowing young organisms to respond differently from more mature organisms 
</p>
<p>(B) organizing gene expression so that genes are expressed in a given order 
</p>
<p>(C) ** allowing the organism to adjust to changes in environmental conditions 
</p>
<p>(D) allowing each gene to be expressed an equal number of times 
</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Using these operons to alter patterns of gene expression in prokaryotes serves an organism’s survival by allowing an organism to adjust to changes in the environmental conditions. Operons are how prokaryotic genes are controlled.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Prokaryotic organisms control the expression of their genes based on the resources present in the environment. The presence or absence of nutrients in the environment will cause the activation or inactivation of the gene expression. The operon is an example of this type of control system.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Prokaryotic gene expression (both transcription and translation) occurs within the cytoplasm of a cell due to the lack of a defined nucleus; thus, the DNA is freely located within the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic gene expression occurs in both the nucleus (transcription) and cytoplasm (translation).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Which of the following levels of gene expression allows the most rapid response to environmental change? Bacterial and eukaryotic cells primarily control gene expression at the level of transcription.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Environmental factors such as diet, temperature, oxygen levels, humidity, light cycles, and the presence of mutagens can all impact which of an animal’s genes are expressed, which ultimately affects the animal’s phenotype.
