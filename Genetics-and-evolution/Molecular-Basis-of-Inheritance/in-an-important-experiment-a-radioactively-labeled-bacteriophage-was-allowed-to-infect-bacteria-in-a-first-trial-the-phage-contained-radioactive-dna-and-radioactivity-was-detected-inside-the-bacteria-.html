<strong> In an important experiment, a radioactively labeled bacteriophage was allowed to infect bacteria. In a first trial, the phage contained radioactive DNA, and radioactivity was detected inside the bacteria. Next, phage-containing radioactive protein was used, and the radioactivity was not detected inside the bacteria. These experiments led to the conclusion that ____ 
</strong>
<p>(A) bacteriophages can infect bacteria 
</p>
<p>(B) ** the genetic material of the phage is DNA 
</p>
<p>(C) DNA is made of nucleotides

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In an important experiment, a radioactively labeled bacteriophage was allowed to infect bacteria. In a first trial the page contained radioactive DNA, and the radioactivity was detected inside the bacteria. Next, phage containing radioactive protein was used, and the radioactivity was not detected inside the bacteria.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Thus, the Hershey-Chase experiment helped confirm that DNA, not protein, is the genetic material. Hershey and Chase’s experiment concluded that little sulfur containing material entered the bacterial cell.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-They knew that bacteriophage T4 was made of protein and DNA. They also knew that proteins contain sulfur atoms but no phosphorus, while DNA contains a great deal of phosphorus and no sulfur. They used radioactive sulfur and phosphorus to label and, so, distinguish viral proteins from viral DNA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The researchers used different radioactive elements to label the DNA and proteins in viruses. This allowed them to identify which molecule the viruses inserted into bacteria. DNA was the molecule they identified. This confirmed that DNA is the genetic material.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Conclusion: Resultant radioactive and non-radioactive bacteria infer that the viruses that had radioactive DNA transferred their DNA to the bacteria but viruses that had radioactive protein didn’t get transferred to the bacteria. Hence, DNA is the genetic material and not the protein.
