<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-DNA is isolated from bacteria undergoing DNA replication. After heat treatment to disrupt H-bonds the DNA is centrifuged and it separates into two classes. One class of DNA includes very large molecules, and the other includes short stretches of DNA.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Helicases are enzymes that bind and may even remodel nucleic acid or nucleic acid protein complexes. There are DNA and RNA helicases. DNA helicases are essential during DNA replication because they separate double-stranded DNA into single strands allowing each strand to be copied.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The similarities between prokaryotic and eukaryotic replication can be understood as follows: Both the replication processes occur before nuclear division. The DNA involved in both processes are double-stranded. The replication occurs in 5’ to 3’ direction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-What would happen if a cell replicates once in the presence of this radioactive bacteria? DNA in both daughter cells would be radioactive.
