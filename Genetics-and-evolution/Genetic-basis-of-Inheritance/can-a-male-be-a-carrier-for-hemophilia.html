<title>Can a male be a carrier for hemophilia?

<meta name="description" content="There are no genes for clotting factors on the Y chromosome. This means that males only have one allele for factor VIII and one allele for factor IX. Thus, if a male has a hemophilia allele on his only X chromosome, he will have the disorder.If the mother has one altered factor gene and the father does not have hemophilia, each son has a 50% chance of having hemophilia and each daughter has a 50% chance of having one altered factor gene, causing her to be a carrier or have hemophilia.The abnormal gene responsible for hemophilia is carried on the X chromosome. Males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. In a male, the presence of the abnormal gene results in the deficiency or absence of factor VIII or factor IX, as there is no protective X to make factor VIII or IX.When a female has one affected X chromosome, she is a carrier of hemophilia. Being a female carrier of hemophilia is not the same as having hemophilia, although female carriers may experience symptoms of hemophilia. A female carrier can also pass the affected X chromosome on to her children.Since the Y chromosome does not carry the hemophilia gene, a son born to a man with hemophilia and a woman who is not a carrier will not have hemophilia.

<strong> Can a male be a carrier for hemophilia? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** No, he cannot be a carrier because he has only one x chromosome. 
</p>
<p>(B) No, he cannot be a carrier because he has only one Y chromosome. 
</p>
<p>(C) Yes, he can be a carrier because he has both an x and Y chromosome. 
</p>
<p>(D) Yes, he can be a carrier because he has two x chromosomes. 
</p>
<p>
<div style ="text-align:center">
<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-There are no genes for clotting factors on the Y chromosome. This means that males only have one allele for factor VIII and one allele for factor IX. Thus, if a male has a hemophilia allele on his only X chromosome, he will have the disorder.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-If the mother has one altered factor gene and the father does not have hemophilia, each son has a 50% chance of having hemophilia and each daughter has a 50% chance of having one altered factor gene, causing her to be a carrier or have hemophilia.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The abnormal gene responsible for hemophilia is carried on the X chromosome. Males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. In a male, the presence of the abnormal gene results in the deficiency or absence of factor VIII or factor IX, as there is no protective X to make factor VIII or IX.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-When a female has one affected X chromosome, she is a “carrier” of hemophilia. Being a female carrier of hemophilia is not the same as having hemophilia, although female carriers may experience symptoms of hemophilia. A female carrier can also pass the affected X chromosome on to her children.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Since the Y chromosome does not carry the hemophilia gene, a son born to a man with hemophilia and a woman who is not a carrier will not have hemophilia. If the baby gets the X chromosome from the father it will be a girl. The X chromosome from the father with hemophilia will have the hemophilia gene.
