<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A woman who is a carrier of an X-linked recessive disorder has a 25% chance of having an unaffected son, a 25% chance of having an affected son, a 25% chance of having an unaffected daughter and a 25% chance of having a daughter who also is a carrier.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-With each pregnancy, a woman who carries an altered gene for X-linked recessive has a 50 percent chance of having sons who are affected and a 50 percent chance of having daughters who carry one copy of the altered gene.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Someone who has one abnormal gene (but no symptoms) is called a carrier. Carriers can pass abnormal genes to their children. The term “sex-linked recessive” most often refers to X-linked recessive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Females may get the defective gene either from her mother’s defective X, or, if her father has the disorder, from her father. In either case, the girl will be a carrier and will probably pass the defect to her offspring.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Sons will be affected if they inherit the mutated X-linked gene from their mother. Fathers cannot pass X-linked recessive conditions to their sons.

<h4>Try yourself to solve below questions:
</h4>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 1 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>How can a female carrier of an X-linked recessive disorder have a female child who is affected? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 2 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>When we say that a woman is a carrier for an X-linked recessive disorder It means that? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 3 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Can a female be a carrier for an X-linked disease? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 4 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What happens with regards to X-linked recessive disorders if a woman has the disorder all of her sons will have it? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 5 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Why is it a female can be carrier of a disease and males won t ever be carried? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 6 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What is the probability that a male and a female who are both carriers of the same autosomal recessive disease will have a child who is affected by the disease?
