<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The resulting characteristic is due to both alleles being expressed equally. An example of this is the blood group AB which is the result of codominance of the A and B dominant alleles. Recessive alleles only show their effect if the individual has two copies of the allele (also known as being homozygous?).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Recessive alleles only express their phenotype if an organism carries two identical copies of the recessive allele, meaning it is homozygous for the recessive allele. This means that the genotype of an organism with a dominant phenotype may be either homozygous or heterozygous for the dominant allele.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The correct answer: The two different dominant alleles are both fully expressed in the phenotype, are referred to as e. codominance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A DOMINANT trait is expressed when two different genes for the same trait are present.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Closely related to incomplete dominance is codominance, in which both alleles are simultaneously expressed in the heterozygote.
