<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Kell antigens are a group of red blood cell antigens that can trigger a strong immune response if you donâ€™t have Kell antigens in your own blood. In most cases, Kell RBC antibodies develop over time after exposure through several blood transfusions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The surface of the human red blood cell is dominated by a small number of abundant blood group active proteins. The major proteins are the anion transport protein (band 3) which has AB(H) activity, and Glycophorin A which has MN activity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Antibodies are protective proteins produced by your immune system. They attach to antigens (foreign substances)-such as bacteria, fungi, viruses and toxins-and remove them from your body.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Antigens are substances (usually proteins) on the surface of cells, viruses, fungi, or bacteria. Nonliving substances such as toxins, chemicals, drugs, and foreign particles (such as a splinter) can also be antigens. The immune system recognizes and destroys, or tries to destroy, substances that contain antigens.
