<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Males are affected more often than females, because the gene is located on the X chromosome. Hemophilia A. Hemophilia A is a disorder where the blood cannot clot properly due to a deficiency of a clotting factor called Factor VIII.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-However, all daughters of a man with hemophilia are considered obligate carriers of hemophilia because they must receive the affected X chromosome from their fathers to be female, and they can pass the gene to their sons. A female with the hemophilia gene is called a hemophilia carrier.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A man who has hemophilia can only pass his altered hemophilia gene on to his daughters, as only his daughters will inherit his altered X chromosome (his sons will inherit his unaffected Y chromosome).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In the United States Hemophilia A affects 1 in 5, 000 male births. About 400 babies are born with hemophilia A each year.
