<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A pedigree shows relationships between family members and indicates which individuals have certain genetic pathogenic variants, traits, and diseases within a family as well as vital status. A pedigree can be used to determine disease inheritance patterns within a family. Standard pedigree nomenclature.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-… A pedigree, as related to genetics, is a chart that diagrams the inheritance of a trait or health condition through generations of a family. The pedigree particularly shows the relationships among family members and, when the information is available, indicates which individuals have a trait(s) of interest.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-What is Pedigree Analysis? Pedigree analysis was developed to understand the inheritance of genes from parents to offspring. It was developed as a chart that can represent a family tree along with the family members and their genetic traits, respectively.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A family tree, also called a genealogy or a pedigree chart, is a chart representing family relationships in a conventional tree structure. More detailed family trees, used in medicine and social work, are known as genograms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The difference between the family tree and the pedigree chart is that the pedigree chart is generally a direct lineage chart that shows only your parents, grandparents, great grandparents, etc. No siblings, aunts, cousins, or Grandpa’s brother Bob.
