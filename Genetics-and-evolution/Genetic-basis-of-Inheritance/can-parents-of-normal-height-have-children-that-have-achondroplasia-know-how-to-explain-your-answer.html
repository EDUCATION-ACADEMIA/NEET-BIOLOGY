<title>Can parents of normal height have children that have achondroplasia? Know how to explain your answer.

<meta name="description" content="Achondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Around 80% of individuals with achondroplasia have parents with average stature and have achondroplasia as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Such parents have a very low risk of having another child with achondroplasia.When both parents have achondroplasia, the chance for them, together, to have a child with normal stature is 25 percent. Their chance of having a child with achondroplasia is 50 percent.This means the parents are of average height and do not have the abnormal gene. However, people with achondroplasia have a 50 percent chance to pass the gene to a child, resulting in the condition.Genetic changes happen randomly. There is nothing a parent could do before or during pregnancy to prevent this change from happening. A genetic counselor can help determine the chances of having a child with dwarfism. Depending on the type of dwarfism, two average-height parents can have a child with short stature.Only one parent needs to pass down the gene for a child to be born with achondroplasia (autosomal dominant). There is a 50% chance of a person with achondroplasia and a partner who does not have achondroplasia having a child with the disorder.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Achondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Around 80% of individuals with achondroplasia have parents with average stature and have achondroplasia as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Such parents have a very low risk of having another child with achondroplasia.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-When both parents have achondroplasia, the chance for them, together, to have a child with normal stature is 25 percent. Their chance of having a child with achondroplasia is 50 percent.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-This means the parents are of average height and do not have the abnormal gene. However, people with achondroplasia have a 50 percent chance to pass the gene to a child, resulting in the condition.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Genetic changes happen randomly. There is nothing a parent could do before or during pregnancy to prevent this change from happening. A genetic counselor can help determine the chances of having a child with dwarfism. Depending on the type of dwarfism, two average-height parents can have a child with short stature.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Only one parent needs to pass down the gene for a child to be born with achondroplasia (autosomal dominant). There is a 50% chance of a person with achondroplasia and a partner who does not have achondroplasia having a child with the disorder.
