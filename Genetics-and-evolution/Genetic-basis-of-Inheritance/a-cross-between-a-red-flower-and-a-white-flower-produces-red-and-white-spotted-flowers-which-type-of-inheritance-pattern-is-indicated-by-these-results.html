<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-This cross illustrates red and white exhibit incomplete dominance. This situation occurs due to the blending of both the alleles. Here, the dominant gene is not in a position to completely suppress the expression of the recessive gene.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In codominance, both alleles are expressed together in the offspring. If we cross a red flower and white flower that have a codominance inheritance pattern, the offspring would be flowers with red and white patches on them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Figure 21: A cross between a red and white snapdragon will yield 100% pink offspring. This pattern of inheritance is described as incomplete dominance, meaning that neither of the alleles is completely dominant over the other: both alleles can be seen at the same time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The example of codominance can be seen in plants with white color as recessive allele and red color as dominant allele produce flowers with pink and white color (spots) after cross-breeding.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Examples of codominance in animals include speckled chickens, which have alleles for both black and white feathers, and roan cattle, which express alleles for both red hair and white hair. Codominance is also seen in plants.
