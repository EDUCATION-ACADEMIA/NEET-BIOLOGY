<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Definition. Codominance, as it relates to genetics, refers to a type of inheritance in which two versions (alleles) of the same gene are expressed separately to yield different traits in an individual.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-If both alleles are dominant, it is called codominance?. The resulting characteristic is due to both alleles being expressed equally. An example of this is the blood group AB which is the result of codominance of the A and B dominant alleles.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-As mentioned earlier, incomplete dominance is a partial dominance, meaning the phenotype is in between the genotype dominant and recessive alleles. In the above example, the resulting offspring has a pink color trait despite the dominant red color and white color trait due to incomplete dominance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Codominance. As opposed to partial dominance, codominance occurs when the phenotypes of both parents are simultaneously expressed in the same offspring organism.
