<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The law of segregation describes how homologous chromosomes (and hence allele pairs) are separated in meiosis I. The law of independent assortment describes how homologous pairs align randomly (as bivalents) during metaphase I.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Mendel’s Segregation law occurs in anaphase (I and II) of meiosis. It is a phase in the first meiotic division in which the homologous chromosomes are segregated into two daughter nuclei with their various versions of each gene.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Mendel’s law of segregation states that: “During the formation of gamete, each gene separates from each other so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene.” Law of segregation is the second law of inheritance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-During meiosis, the pairs of homologous chromosome are divided in half to form haploid cells, and this separation, or assortment, of homologous chromosomes is random. This means that all of the maternal chromosomes will not be separated into one cell, while the all paternal chromosomes are separated into another.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Gregor Mendel’s law of segregation states that the two alleles for each trait segregate, or separate, during the formation of gametes, and that during the formation of new zygotes, the alleles will combine at random with other alleles.
