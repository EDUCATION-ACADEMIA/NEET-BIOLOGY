<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The test cross is another fundamental tool devised by Gregor Mendel . In its simplest form, a test cross is an experimental cross of an individual organism of dominant phenotype but unknown genotype and an organism with a homozygous recessive genotype (and phenotype).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A test cross is a breeding experiment in which an organism with an unknown genotype associated with the dominant phenotype is mated to an organism that is homozygous for the recessive phenotype. The Punnett square in Figure 8 can be used to consider how the identity of the unknown allele is determined in a test cross.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In order to find the unknown genotype of the dominant character, a cross breeding is performed which is called test crossing. Here the unknown dominant character is crossed with the known recessive character, for example, tall plant (its genotype is not known) is crossed to dwarf (its genotype is known).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A testcross can be used to determine the organism’s genotype. In a testcross, the individual with the unknown genotype is crossed with a homozygous recessive individual (Figure below).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-So, the correct answer is “ Test cross".

<p>What do you call a cross between an organism with unknown genotype and a recessive parent? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 12 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What process would be used to determine if an organism that displays a dominant phenotype is heterozygous or homozygo? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 13 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What type of cross is used when mating between parent that are both homozygous for two Traits ? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 14 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What are the phenotypic and genotypic ratio for a cross between a homozygous dominant individual and a heterozygous individual? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 15 :
</strong>
</p>
