<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: It was important that Mendel examined not just the F1 generation in his breeding experiments, but the F2 generation as well, because b) parental traits that were not observed in the F1 reappeared in the F2. Mendel chose some parental generations for the crossing and generation of F1 progeny.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Why did Mendel need to grow two offspring generations (F1 and F2) to develop his law of segregation? because the first generation offspring had just one form of each trait. The reason is that one of the two factors controlling each trait was dominant to the other factor.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-This diagram shows Mendel’s first experiment with pea plants. The F1 generation results from cross-pollination of two parent (P) plants, and contained all purple flowers. The F2 generation results from self-pollination of F1 plants, and contained 75% purple flowers and 25% white flowers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The traits that did not appear in the F1 generation were called recessive traits. When Mendel allowed the F1 generation to self-pollinate, the recessive traits reappeared in the resulting F2 generation.
