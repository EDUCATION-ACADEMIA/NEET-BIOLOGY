<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Question: If a family has four children, what is the probability that all 4 are the same sex? We have 16 possible outcomes, from which only two satisfy your requirement: MMMM and GGGG. So, the answer is 2/16 = 1/8.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Neither parent gets to decide. Almost everyone has around a 50% chance of having a boy and a 50% chance of having a girl. What we can say is that dad’s sperm determines whether a baby will be born as a boy or a girl. About half of his sperm will make a boy and half a girl.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A family has four children. If the genders of these children are listed in the order they are born, there are sixteen possible outcomes: BBBB, BBBG, BBGB, BGBB, GBBB, BGBG, GBGB, BGGB, GBBG, BBGG, GGBB, BGGG, GBGG, GGBG, GGGB, and GGGG.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-e) Since births of children are independent of each other, the first child’s sex has no bearing on the other’s. Since about half of the births are male, the probability of the second child being a boy is . 50.
