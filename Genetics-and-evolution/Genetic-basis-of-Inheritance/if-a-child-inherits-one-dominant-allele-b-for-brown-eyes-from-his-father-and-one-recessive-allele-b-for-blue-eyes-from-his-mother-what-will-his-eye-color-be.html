<title>If a child inherits one dominant allele (B) for brown eyes from his father and one recessive allele (b) for blue eyes from his mother, what will his eye color be?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="If the father has one dominant and one recessive allele, the child has a 50 percent chance of having brown eyes and a 50 percent chance of having blue eyes. We can observe that of the eight possible combinations of genes the child could inherit, only two will code for blue eyes.Eye colour So, if you have one allele for brown eyes and one allele for blue eyes (Bb), your eyes will be brown. (This is also the case if you have two alleles for brown eyes, BB.) However, if both alleles are for the recessive trait (in this case, blue eyes, bb) you will inherit blue eyes.If both of you have brown eyes, then there is generally a 25% chance that the baby will have blue eyes if both of you carry the recessive blue-eye gene. But if only one of you has a recessive blue-eye gene, and the other has two brown, dominant genes, then there is a less than 1% chance of the baby having blue eyes.Of these three genotypes, only bb, the homozygous recessive genotype, will produce a phenotype of blue eyes. The heterozygous genotype and the homozygous dominant genotype both will produce brown eyes, though only the heterozygous genotype can pass on the gene for blue eyes.Brown eye colour is dominant over blue eye colour. Therefore, for the brown-eyed parents having blue-eyed child, the possibility is that both have heterozygous genotype i.e. Bb. Therefore, from the square below, it is clear that there is a 25% possibility of blue-eyed (bb) child.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-If the father has one dominant and one recessive allele, the child has a 50 percent chance of having brown eyes and a 50 percent chance of having blue eyes. We can observe that of the eight possible combinations of genes the child could inherit, only two will code for blue eyes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Eye colour So, if you have one allele for brown eyes and one allele for blue eyes (Bb), your eyes will be brown. (This is also the case if you have two alleles for brown eyes, BB.) However, if both alleles are for the recessive trait (in this case, blue eyes, bb) you will inherit blue eyes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If both of you have brown eyes, then there is generally a 25% chance that the baby will have blue eyes if both of you carry the recessive blue-eye gene. But if only one of you has a recessive blue-eye gene, and the other has two brown, dominant genes, then there is a less than 1% chance of the baby having blue eyes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Of these three genotypes, only bb, the homozygous recessive genotype, will produce a phenotype of blue eyes. The heterozygous genotype and the homozygous dominant genotype both will produce brown eyes, though only the heterozygous genotype can pass on the gene for blue eyes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Brown eye colour is dominant over blue eye colour. Therefore, for the brown-eyed parents having blue-eyed child, the possibility is that both have heterozygous genotype i.e. Bb. Therefore, from the square below, it is clear that there is a 25% possibility of blue-eyed (bb) child.
