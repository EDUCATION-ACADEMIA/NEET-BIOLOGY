<title>Which organism did Mendel utilize to work out the laws of segregation and independent assortment?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Gregor Mendel studied inheritance of traits in pea plants. He proposed a model where pairs of heritable elements, or genes, specified traits. Genes come in different versions, or alleles. A dominant allele hides a recessive allele and determines the organisms appearance.The law of segregation states that the two alleles of a single trait will separate randomly, meaning that there is a 50% either allele will end up in either gamete. This has to do with 1 gene. The law of independent assortment states that the allele of one gene separates independently of an allele of another gene.Mendel was curious about how traits were transferred from one generation to the next, so he set out to understand the principles of heredity in the mid-1860s. Peas were a good model system, because he could easily control their fertilization by transferring pollen with a small paintbrush.Gregor Mendel, through his work on pea plants, discovered the fundamental laws of inheritance. He deduced that genes come in pairs and are inherited as distinct units, one from each parent. Mendel tracked the segregation of parental genes and their appearance in the offspring as dominant or recessive traits.Mendel carried out his key experiments using the garden pea, Pisum sativum, as a model system. Pea plants make a convenient system for studies of inheritance, and they are still studied by some geneticists today.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Gregor Mendel studied inheritance of traits in pea plants. He proposed a model where pairs of “heritable elements, ” or genes, specified traits. Genes come in different versions, or alleles. A dominant allele hides a recessive allele and determines the organism’s appearance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The law of segregation states that the two alleles of a single trait will separate randomly, meaning that there is a 50% either allele will end up in either gamete. This has to do with 1 gene. The law of independent assortment states that the allele of one gene separates independently of an allele of another gene.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Mendel was curious about how traits were transferred from one generation to the next, so he set out to understand the principles of heredity in the mid-1860s. Peas were a good model system, because he could easily control their fertilization by transferring pollen with a small paintbrush.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Gregor Mendel, through his work on pea plants, discovered the fundamental laws of inheritance. He deduced that genes come in pairs and are inherited as distinct units, one from each parent. Mendel tracked the segregation of parental genes and their appearance in the offspring as dominant or recessive traits.

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Mendel carried out his key experiments using the garden pea, Pisum sativum, as a model system. Pea plants make a convenient system for studies of inheritance, and they are still studied by some geneticists today.
