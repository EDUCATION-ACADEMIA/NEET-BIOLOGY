<meta name="description" content="Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive inherited metabolic disease. The mutation is located on the long arm of chromosome 7. Due to a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, chloride ion transport is reduced across the cell membrane.Cystic fibrosis affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat and digestive juices. These secreted fluids are normally thin and slippery. But in people with CF, a defective gene causes the secretions to become sticky and thick.In people with CF, mutations in the CFTR gene can disrupt the normal production or functioning of the CFTR protein found in the cells of the lungs and other parts of the body. Cystic fibrosis is an example of a recessive disease. That means a person must have a mutation in both copies of the CFTR gene to have CF.Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease characterized by an abnormality in the glands that produce sweat and mucus.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive inherited metabolic disease. The mutation is located on the long arm of chromosome 7. Due to a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, chloride ion transport is reduced across the cell membrane.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Cystic fibrosis affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat and digestive juices. These secreted fluids are normally thin and slippery. But in people with CF, a defective gene causes the secretions to become sticky and thick.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In people with CF, mutations in the CFTR gene can disrupt the normal production or functioning of the CFTR protein found in the cells of the lungs and other parts of the body. Cystic fibrosis is an example of a recessive disease. That means a person must have a mutation in both copies of the CFTR gene to have CF.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease characterized by an abnormality in the glands that produce sweat and mucus. Cystic fibrosis affects various organ systems in children and young adults, including the respiratory system, digestive system and reproductive system.
