<title>If a female has a sex-linked trait .....
</title>
<meta name="description" content="If only the father or the mother has the mutated X-linked gene, the daughters are usually not affected and are called carriers because one of their X chromosomes has the mutation but the other one is normal. Sons will be affected if they inherit the mutated X-linked gene from their mother.Females may get the defective gene either from her mothers defective X, or, if her father has the disorder, from her father. In either case, the girl will be a carrier and will probably pass the defect to her offspring.A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons (no male-to-male transmission). A condition is considered Y-linked if the altered gene that causes the disorder is located on the Y chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes in each of a males cells.Thats because X-linked conditions are usually caused when you dont have any working copies of a gene on the X-chromosome. Men only have one X-chromosome to begin with. So they only need one non-working (or mutated) gene to show symptoms of an X-linked condition. But, women have an extra X-chromosome!A woman who is a carrier of an X-linked recessive disorder has a 25% chance of having an unaffected son, a 25% chance of having an affected son, a 25% chance of having an unaffected daughter and a 25% chance of having a daughter who also is a carrier.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-If only the father or the mother has the mutated X-linked gene, the daughters are usually not affected and are called carriers because one of their X chromosomes has the mutation but the other one is normal. Sons will be affected if they inherit the mutated X-linked gene from their mother.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Females may get the defective gene either from her mother’s defective X, or, if her father has the disorder, from her father. In either case, the girl will be a carrier and will probably pass the defect to her offspring.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons (no male-to-male transmission). A condition is considered Y-linked if the altered gene that causes the disorder is located on the Y chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes in each of a male’s cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-That’s because X-linked conditions are usually caused when you don’t have any working copies of a gene on the X-chromosome. Men only have one X-chromosome to begin with. So they only need one non-working (or mutated) gene to show symptoms of an X-linked condition. But, women have an extra X-chromosome!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A woman who is a carrier of an X-linked recessive disorder has a 25% chance of having an unaffected son, a 25% chance of having an affected son, a 25% chance of having an unaffected daughter and a 25% chance of having a daughter who also is a carrier.
